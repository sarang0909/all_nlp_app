Sept 9 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is considering setting up a lithium refinery on the gulf coast of Texas, as it looks to secure supply of the key component used in batteries amid surging demand for electric vehicles.

The potential battery-grade lithium hydroxide refining facility, which Tesla touted as the first of its kind in North America, will process ""raw ore material into a usable state for battery production"", the company said in an application filed with the Texas Comptroller's Office.

A decision to invest in Texas will also be based on the ability to obtain relief on local property taxes, Tesla said.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has previously said that Tesla may have to enter the mining and refining industry directly at scale as lithium prices surge.

Musk has also been vocal about the need for more players in the lithium refining industry. ""You can't lose. It's licensed to print money,"" he had said at the company's second-quarter earnings call.

Securing a steady supply of battery components is seen critical for Tesla as it faces fierce competition in the fast-growing market for electric cars.

If approved, construction could begin in the fourth quarter of 2022 and would reach commercial production by the end of 2024, Tesla said in the application dated Aug. 22.

Under the plan, Tesla will ship the final product from the refinery by trucks and rail to various Tesla battery manufacturing sites supporting the supply chain for large-scale and electric vehicle batteries.

Tesla, whose shares rose 1.4% in premarket trading, also said it would use less hazardous reagents and create usable byproducts, compared with the conventional process.

LITHIUM SCRAMBLE

Lithium prices have skyrocketed this year due to surging demand from the auto sector. China remains the world's largest lithium processor, though proposed rival projects in the United States and European Union have faced a range of setbacks. read more

If Tesla's plan goes ahead, the carmaker could become the first in the sector to invest directly in lithium refining as automakers scramble to stitch up deals with miners and refiners.

""Car-makers are trying to ensure they have control over the supply of lithium, hedging for any geopolitical situation that might arise in future where the supply is disrupted,"" said Arpit Agarwal, director at venture capital firm Blume Ventures, which has backed EV startups such as Euler Motors and Yulu.

Tesla also stands to gain from lower logistics costs as well as incentives it may get from the U.S. government, he added.

Battery makers are also looking to increase production in the United States, where a shift toward EVs could increase as the country implements stricter regulation and tightens tax credit eligibility.

Tesla itself signed a five-year supply deal with Australia's Liontown Resources (LTR.AX) earlier this year, while rival EV makers Stellantis (STLA.MI) and Byd have invested in miners around the world.

CATL, the world's biggest battery maker, has also taken stakes in lithium miners.

MILAN/DETROIT, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Jeep will launch four all-electric sport utility vehicles by the end of 2025 in a bid to lead in electrification of off-road vehicles, the company announced on Thursday, despite the Stellantis NV (STLA.MI) brand's late start.

Jeep brand executives previewed an all-electric Jeep Recon, inspired by the brand's petroleum-fueled Wrangler adventure vehicle, a Wagoneer S that will be a battery-electric companion to the brand's Grand Cherokee or Wagoneer family vehicles. They also previewed a small Jeep Avenger EV aimed at Europeans.

Jeep brand chief Christian Meunier said future electric Jeep models - including some not identified in presentations to reporters on Wednesday - will help Jeep meet challenges from other electric vehicle brands.

Rivian and Scout, as well as General Motors Co's reborn Hummer brand, are pitching their electric SUVs to would-be buyers with many of the same appeals to outdoor adventure and all-weather capability that Jeep has traded on for decades. Tesla's Model X and Model Y SUVs compete with Jeep for customers who like multi-purpose utility.

Meunier said the electric Recon and Wagoneer models, due to go on sale in 2024, and the European Avenger, scheduled to go on sale early 2023, should help the brand grow.

""We are not done with growth, but we want to do it in the right way,"" Meunier said, adding he could not provide volume projections for coming years.

Jeep is now aiming to have 50% of its U.S. sales and 100% of its European sales to be of fully electric vehicles by 2030, Meunier said.

Meunier said Jeep intends to offer its electric models in China, but he did not give specific plans. Stellantis in July said it would revamp its strategy for Jeep in China, ending a joint venture with Chinese automaker GAC and shifting toward an imported lineup.

In Europe, Jeep wants to use the Avenger to expand its share of the compact SUV segment, where it already offers the Renegade model, said Antonella Bruno, the brand's chief for Europe.

""The Avenger will target younger and more feminine customers,"" Bruno said.

Italy is currently Jeep's largest market in Europe, accounting for 50% of its sales in the region and the brand hopes to grow to Germany, France and the UK.

State claims company had racially segregated workplace marked by harassment and pay disparities

(Reuters) - A California civil rights agency's lawsuit accusing Tesla Inc of widespread discrimination and harassment against Black workers at its Fremont assembly plant will proceed after a state judge denied the electric car maker's bid to toss the case.

California Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo in Oakland on Friday rejected the company's argument that the case was improperly broad, and that the state's Civil Rights Department failed to notify it of the claims or give it a chance to settle before suing.

In the February lawsuit, the agency described Tesla's flagship Fremont plant as a racially segregated workplace where Black employees were harassed and discriminated against in terms of job assignments, discipline and pay.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The agency said Black workers were assigned difficult, menial jobs in racially segregated areas of the factory known as ""the dark side,"" were less likely to be promoted to management positions and were subjected to racial slurs on a daily basis.

Tesla has denied wrongdoing.

Grillo's Friday ruling finalized a tentative ruling he had issued against the company on Aug. 24.

Spokespeople for the state and for Tesla's lawyers declined to comment.

In its motion to dismiss the case, Tesla argued that the agency's lawsuit made so many claims, involving so many employees, that it would not be legally practical for a court to address the matter in a single case.

Tesla is also facing a series of race and sex discrimination lawsuits brought by employees themselves, mostly involving the Fremont plant.

In one of those cases, a federal judge in April cut a jury verdict for a Black worker who alleged racial harassment from $137 million to $15 million. The plaintiff rejected the reduced award and opted for a new trial, which is scheduled for next March.

While the allegations in the Civil Rights Department's lawsuit are similar to those in other pending cases, it will likely cover many more workers because the agency is not bound by employment agreements that most Tesla employees signed requiring them to arbitrate legal claims.

Tesla's chief executive is Elon Musk, the world's richest person.

The case is Department of Fair Employment and Housing v. Tesla Inc, Superior Court of California, County of Alameda, No. 22-CV-006830.

California Governor Gavin Newsom first announced the plan to phase out vehicles that run only on gasoline by 2035 in September 2020. The California Air Resources Board voted on Thursday to approve the new rules, which set yearly rising zero- emission vehicle rules starting in 2026, but the Biden administration must still approve the new requirements before the plan can take effect.

California has moved faster than the federal government and other states in setting strict standards for vehicle emissions. More than a dozen other states have adopted California's earlier zero-emission requirements.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

""This is a historic moment for California, for our partner states and for the world as we set forth a path toward a zero emission future,"" said CARB Chair Liane Randolph.

California officials said the rules by 2037 will cut by 25% smog-causing pollution from light-duty vehicles. The rules mandate that 35% of the new cars sold be plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), EVs or hydrogen fuel cell by 2026. That proportion will rise to 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.

By 2030, there will be 2.9 million fewer new gas-powered vehicles sold, widening to 9.5 million fewer conventional vehicles by 2035, CARB said.

Steve Douglas, a vice president at the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and other automakers, said on Thursday the CARB rules ""are the most sweeping and transformative regulations in the history of the automobile.""

Electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) called for a faster route to all-electric sales, but the auto group said the regulations will be ""extremely challenging even in California and particularly in the early years.""

California is ahead of federal vehicle emissions rules, which currently extend only to 2026 and do not set yearly requirements for zero-emission models.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria Read More

CARB's new regulation would allow automakers to sell up to 20% PHEVs by 2035. That may boost Toyota, which is investing heavily in plug-ins, and which agreed earlier this week to recognize California's authority to set vehicle rules.

Tesla, which produces only electric vehicles, said in a July 26 filing to CARB that the board should require 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and increase the stringency of the standard by ""reducing the use of polluting PHEVs in annual compliance."" It also sought changes on battery and charging cord requirements.

Tesla Senior Counsel Joseph Mendelson said on Thursday the CARB proposal ""is both achievable and paves the way for California to lead in electrifying the light duty sector.""

CARB's proposal sets tough new requirements for plug-in hybrids, which currently must have at least 10 miles (16.1 km)all-electric range and will eventually need a minimum 50-mile all-electric range label to qualify.

CARB projects that 183,000 out of about 2 million vehicles sold in California in 2035 will be plug-in hybrid.

The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association on Thursday urged President Joe Biden and the Environmental Protection Agency to ""reject California’s request for a Clean Air Act waiver to proceed with this unlawful ban.""

The group said federal approval ""would hand over sweeping federal government authority to California regulators, effectively appointing Governor Newsom and CARB as car and truck czars for the entire United States.""

The White House and EPA did not immediately comment. Biden has previously declined to back setting a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. The EPA is currently working on the next round of U.S. emissions limits through at least 2030.

Seventeen U.S. states have agreed to adopt California's tailpipe emissions rules and 15 have backed its zero-emission vehicle requirements. A group of 17 other states has challenged the EPA's decision to restore California's authority to set emissions rules that was withdrawn under former president Donald Trump.

Sept 14 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) was sued on Wednesday in a proposed class action accusing Elon Musk's electric car company of misleading the public by falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features.

The complaint accused Tesla and Musk of having since 2016 deceptively advertised the technology as fully functioning or ""just around the corner"" despite knowing that the technology did not work or was nonexistent, and made vehicles unsafe.

Briggs Matsko, the named plaintiff, said Tesla did this to ""generate excitement"" about its vehicles, attract investments, boost sales, avoid bankruptcy, drive up its stock price and become a ""dominant player"" in electric vehicles.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

""Tesla has yet to produce anything even remotely approaching a fully self-driving car,"" Matsko said.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco seeks unspecified damages for people who since 2016 bought or leased Tesla vehicles with Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features.

Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It disbanded its media relations department in 2020.

The lawsuit followed complaints filed on July 28 by California's Department of Motor Vehicles accusing Tesla of overstating how well its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) worked. read more

Remedies there could include suspending Tesla's license in California, and requiring restitution to drivers.

Tesla has said Autopilot enables vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake within their lanes, while Full Self-Driving lets vehicles obey traffic signals and change lanes.

It has also said both technologies ""require active driver supervision,"" with a ""fully attentive"" driver whose hands are on the wheel, ""and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

Matsko, of Rancho Murieta, California, said he paid a $5,000 premium for his 2018 Tesla Model X to obtain Enhanced Autopilot.

He also said Tesla drivers who receive software updates ""effectively act as untrained test engineers"" and have found ""myriad problems,"" including that vehicles steer into oncoming traffic, run red lights, and fail to make routine turns.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has since 2016 opened 38 special investigations of Tesla crashes believed to involve ADAS. Nineteen deaths were reported in those crashes.

The case is Matsko v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-05240.

Workers say Tesla flouted law requiring 60 days' notice of layoffs

Judge won't nix agreements signed since lawsuit was filed

Sept 19 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc must notify factory workers who were laid off in the last three months of a proposed class action accusing the electric carmaker of failing to give adequate notice before engaging in mass layoffs, a federal magistrate judge has ruled.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan Hightower in Austin, Texas said on Friday that separation agreements Tesla asked workers who were terminated to sign may have been misleading and caused them to waive their rights under the federal law requiring employers with 100 or more employees to give 60 days' notice of layoffs.

Hightower, however, denied a request by the plaintiffs who sued Tesla in June to bar the company from communicating with potential class members and to strike down separation agreements Tesla has procured since the lawsuit was filed, saying it was too broad.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

A representative of Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shannon Liss-Riordan, who represents the plaintiffs, said on Monday that Tesla has been trying to get workers to sign away their right under federal law to 60 days of pay while offering them only a week or two of pay.

Liss-Riordan in an email said Tesla chief executive Elon Musk ""called this case 'trivial,' but the federal court has made clear that Tesla's actions in ignoring the law are anything but trivial.""

The federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires businesses to notify workers of mass layoffs at least 60 days in advance unless they are caused by natural disasters or ""unforeseeable business circumstances.""

The lawsuit by two former Tesla employees accuses the company of violating the WARN Act by abruptly laying off more than 500 workers at its Sparks, Nevada gigafactory as part of a nationwide purge of its workforce.

Tesla has laid off hundreds of employees since June, when Musk in an email told company executives to freeze hiring and cut about 10% of salaried staff. Musk later clarified that he expected Tesla's total workforce to grow in the coming year.

Tesla has moved to dismiss the case, claiming it was merely ""right-sizing"" by firing poorly performing workers and not engaging in layoffs that require advance notice. The company also says workers who lost their jobs signed agreements to bring legal disputes in arbitration rather than court.

The plaintiffs are seeking class action status for all former Tesla employees throughout the United States who were laid off in May or June without advance notice.

The case is Lynch v. Tesla Inc, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, No. 1:22-cv-00597.

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has filed a lawsuit to challenge Louisiana's refusal to allow the company to sell vehicles directly to consumers, calling the U.S. state's move protectionist and anti-competitive.

The case is the latest battle to reverse direct sales bans in some states against the electric carmaker, which bypassed traditional car dealerships. In those states, consumers have to travel to neighboring states to secure Tesla vehicles.

Tesla claimed Louisiana officials have violated state and federal antitrust laws by barring direct sales since 2017 and trying to restrict the leasing and servicing of its cars in Louisiana.

""Louisiana consumers' freedom is being unduly restricted by protectionist, anti-competitive and inefficient state regulation,"" according to the lawsuit, which was filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.

Tesla accused Louisiana dealers, dealer association and some members of the Motor Vehicle Commission of entering an ""unlawful conspiracy to bar Tesla from doing business in Louisiana.""

In 2016, Tesla also sued Michigan for the state's direct sales ban and reached a settlement in 2020 under which Tesla can have its cars serviced in Michigan through a subsidiary.

Tesla has rushed its autonomous driving cars to market with unsafe technology, including its driver assistant system which the company calls Autopilot or Full Self-Driving, and its emergency braking system, according to the lawsuit by Jose Alvarez Toledo of San Francisco.

This adds to growing public and regulatory scrutiny of Tesla's driver assistant technology, despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk promising full self-driving by this year-end. read more

""When the sudden unintended braking defect occurs, they turn what is supposed to be a safety feature into a frightening and dangerous nightmare,"" said Toledo's lawsuit, which was filed on Friday in federal court in the northern district of California.

The lawsuit seeks class action status for all U.S. owners or leasors of a Tesla that suffers from the sudden unintended braking defect.

Tesla did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comments.

In February, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into 416,000 Tesla vehicles over reports of unexpected brake activation tied to Autopilot. read more

The lawsuit accused Tesla of fraudulently hiding the safety risks associated with Autopilot, breaching its warranties, unfairly profiting from Autopilot and violating California's unfair competition law.

The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for expenses to repair vehicles, diminished value of Tesla cars and for a refund of the added cost attributed to the Autopilot feature, according to the lawsuit.

Savings from bigger cells and new manufacturing process

Tesla yet to ramp up new 'dry-coating' technique - experts

Sept 6 (Reuters) - The secret behind Elon Musk's goal of selling 20 million Tesla's a year by 2030 lies in its pioneering battery technology.

The good news is that by using bigger cells and a new process to dry-coat electrodes, Tesla could halve the cost of a Model Y battery, saving more than 8% of the car's U.S. starting price, battery experts with ties to the company said.

The bad news is that it's only halfway there, according to 12 experts close to Tesla or familiar with its new technology.

That's because the dry-coating technique used to produce the bigger cells in Tesla's 4680 battery is so new and unproven the company is having trouble scaling up manufacturing to the point where the big cost savings kick in, the experts told Reuters.

""They just aren't ready for mass production,"" said one of the experts close to Tesla (TSLA.O).

Still, the gains Tesla has already made in cutting battery production costs in the past two years could help boost profits and extend its lead over most electric vehicle (EV) rivals.

Musk's promised improvements in battery cost and performance are seen by investors as critical to Tesla's quest to usher in an era where it can sell a $25,000 EV for a profit - and stand a better chance of hitting its 2030 targets. read more

Battery systems are the most expensive single element in most EVs, so making lower-cost, high-performance packs is key to producing affordable electric cars that can go toe to toe with combustion-engine rivals on sticker prices.

Tesla is one of only a handful of major automakers that produce their own EV batteries and by manufacturing Model Y cells at U.S. plants, the SUV will remain eligible for U.S. tax credits when many rival EVs may no longer qualify.

Among the 12 battery experts Reuters spoke with, nine have close ties to Tesla and three of the nine have examined Tesla's new and old battery technology inside and out through teardowns.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

'HE WILL SOLVE IT'

The sources predict that Tesla will find it difficult to fully implement the new dry-coating manufacturing process before the end of this year, and perhaps not until 2023.

Stan Whittingham, a co-inventor of lithium-ion batteries and a 2019 Nobel laureate, believes Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has been overly optimistic on the time frame for commercializing the new technique.

""I think he will solve it, but it won't be as quick as he likes. It's going to take some time to really test it,"" he said.

In August, Musk told shareholders Tesla would be producing high volumes of 4680 batteries by the end of 2022.

According to the experts, Tesla has only been able to cut the Model Y's battery cost by between $2,000 and $3,000 so far, about half the savings Tesla had planned for the 4680 battery, which it unveiled two years ago.

But those savings have come mainly from the design of the new 4680 cells, which are bigger than those in Tesla's current 2170 battery, they said.

But the heart of the drive to push down costs is the dry-coating technology, which Musk has described as revolutionary but difficult to execute.

According to the sources, it should deliver as much as half of the $5,500 cost savings Tesla hopes to achieve, by slashing manufacturing costs and one-time capital spending.

Tesla acquired the know-how in 2019 when it paid over $200 million for Maxwell Technologies, a company in San Diego making ultracapacitors, which store energy for devices that need quick bursts of electricity, such as camera flashes.

Building on Maxwell's technology, Tesla began making 4680 dry cells this year, first in a pilot near its Fremont, California plant and more recently at its new global headquarters in Austin, Texas.

'BEST IN CLASS'

The technology allows Tesla to ditch the older, more complex and costly wet-coating process. It's expensive because it needs a substantial amount of electricity, machinery, factory space, time, and a large labour force.

To coat electrodes in the wet process, battery producers mix the materials with toxic binder solvents. Once coated, the electrodes are dried in massive ovens, with the toxic solvents that evaporate in the process being recovered, treated and recycled - all adding to the cost.

With the new technology, electrodes are coated using different binders with little use of liquids, so they don't need to be dried. That means it's cheaper, faster and also less environmentally damaging.

Because of its simplicity, the process allows Tesla to cut capital spending by a third and slash both the footprint of a factory and its energy consumption to a 10th of what would be needed for the wet process, Tesla has said.

But the company has had trouble commercializing the process, the sources said.

Maxwell developed its dry-coat process for ultracapacitors, but the challenge with coating electrodes for EV batteries is that they are much larger and thicker, which makes it hard to coat them with consistent quality at mass-production speeds.

""They can produce in small volume, but when they started big volume production, Tesla ended up with many rejects, too many,"" one of the sources with ties to Tesla told Reuters.

Production yields were so low that all the anticipated cost savings from the new process were lost, the source said.

If all the potential efficiencies from dry-coating and the bigger cells are realised, the manufacturing cost for the Model Y’s 4680 battery pack should fall to $5,000 to $5,500 - roughly half the cost of the 2170 pack, according to the sources.

The rising cost of battery materials and energy pose a risk to those forecasts, however, and Tesla has not yet been able to significantly improve the new battery's energy density or the amount of power it packs, as Musk has promised.

Still, despite those factors, the savings Tesla is expected to achieve will end up making the 4680 battery the industry's ""best in class"" for the foreseeable future, one source said.

BULKING UP

Much of the $2,000 to $3,000 cost savings achieved with the 4680 battery so far has come from other improvements, and using bigger cells has proven particularly potent, the experts said.

The 4680 cells are 5.5 times the size of the 2170 cells by volume. The older cylindrical cells measure 21mm in diameter and 70mm in height, hence the name. The 4680 cells have a 46mm diameter and are 80mm high.

With the older technology, Tesla needs about 4,400 cells to power the Model Y and there are 17,600 points that need to be welded - four per cell - to create a pack that can be integrated into the car, the sources said.

The 4680 battery pack only needs 830 cells and Tesla has changed the design so that there are only two weld points per cell, slashing the welding to 1,660 points and leading to significant cost savings.

The simpler design also means there are fewer connectors and other components, which has allowed Tesla to save further on labour costs and machine time.

Another source of efficiency has been the larger cell's far sturdier outer case. Tesla can now bond the cells together with adhesive into a rigid honeycomb-like pack which is then connected directly to the inner body structure of the Model Y.

This eliminates the intermediate step of bundling cells into larger modules which are then installed in a traditional battery pack, the sources said.

By shifting to this ""cell to vehicle"" design, Tesla can reduce the weight of a traditional 1,200-pound battery pack by 55 pounds or more - saving about $500 to $600 per pack, one of the sources said.

But mastering the dry-coating technique remains the holy grail.

""Bulking up the battery cell helped a lot in boosting efficiency, but pushing for 50% cost savings for the cell as a whole is another matter,"" one source said.

""That will depend on whether Tesla can deploy the dry-coating process successfully in a factory.""

My, how times have changed.

Musk's Texas company now is floating ambitious plans to deploy thousands of humanoid robots, known as Tesla Bot or Optimus, within its factories, expanding eventually to millions around the world, according to job postings. Buzz is building within the company as Tesla is having more internal meetings on robots, a person familiar with the matter said.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Longer term, Musk said at a TED Talk robots could be used in homes, making dinner, mowing the lawn and caring for the elderly people, and even becoming a ""buddy"" or a ""catgirl"" sex partner.

The robot business eventually may be worth more than Tesla's car revenue, according to Musk, who is now touting a vision for the company that goes well beyond making self-driving electric vehicles.

At its ""AI Day"" on Sept. 30, Tesla will unveil a prototype from its project Optimus, an allusion to the powerful and benevolent leader of the Autobots in the Transformers series. Production could start next year, Musk said.

Tesla faces skepticism that it can show technological advances that would justify the expense of ""general purpose"" robots in factories, homes and elsewhere, according to robotics experts, investors and analysts interviewed by Reuters.

Tesla already employs hundreds of robots designed for specific jobs for production of its cars.

Humanoid robots have been in development for decades by Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS)'s Boston Dynamics unit. Like self-driving cars, the robots have trouble with unpredictable situations. read more

""Self-driving cars weren't really proved to be as easy as anyone thought. And it's the same way with humanoid robots to some extent,"" the lead of NASA's Dexterous Robotics Team, Shaun Azimi, told Reuters.

""If something unexpected happens, being flexible and robust to those kinds of changes is very difficult.""

At an ""Autonomy"" event in 2019, Musk promised 1 million robotaxis by 2020 but has yet to deliver such a car.

Musk's robots may be able to demonstrate basic capabilities at the event, but it would be hard for them to impress public expectations of robots that are as capable as humans, experts say.

To succeed, Tesla will need to show robots doing multiple, unscripted actions, said Nancy Cooke, a professor in human systems engineering at Arizona State University. Such proof could provide a boost to Tesla stock, which is down 25% from its 2021 peak.

""If he just gets the robot to walk around, or he gets the robots to dance, that's already been done. That's not that impressive,"" she said.

Tesla did not respond to Reuters' request for comments, but Musk in the past proved skeptics wrong, jump-starting the electric car market and building a rocket company, SpaceX, although some product launches were behind schedule.

IN-HOUSE EXPERTISE

Initially, Optimus will perform boring or dangerous jobs, including moving parts around its factories, according to Musk.

Musk acknowledged that humanoid robots do not have enough intelligence to navigate the real world without being explicitly instructed.

But he said Tesla can leverage its expertise in AI and key components to develop and produce smart, yet less expensive, humanoid robots at scale.

He tweeted on Monday that its Autopilot team is also working on its Optimus robot, when asked about fixes of what it calls Full Self-Driving beta - a test version of its new automated driving software.

Tesla is on hiring spree for people to work on humanoid bi-pedal robots, with about 20 job postings on ""Tesla Bot"" including jobs for designing key robot parts like ""actuators"".

""The code you will write will at term run in millions of humanoid robots across the world, and will therefore be held to high quality standards,"" one of the job postings said.

Tesla has over 2 million vehicles on the road.

Jonathan Hurst, chief technology officer at Agility Robotics, a humanoid robot firm founded in 2015 said the technology ""is right now starting to turn the corner.""

""Certainly, an important measure of success is do they make money from it,"" he told Reuters, referring to Tesla's humanoid robot efforts.

HUMAN HELP?

Analysts see more pageant than product. ""It's all part of distracting people and giving them the next shiny object to chase after,"" Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid said.

""Investors are not excited about Optimus,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, which holds Tesla stocks. ""It's just such a low probability that it works at scale,"" he said, saying it is ""infinitely harder than self-driving cars.""

And then there is Musk's own experience with robots in the factory.

During the 2018 production hell, Musk specifically noted the problems of the ""fluff bot,"" an assembly robot that failed to perform simple tasks that human hands can do - picking up pieces of ""fluff"" and placing them on batteries.

He said the cost of having technicians maintain the complicated robot far exceeded that of hiring someone to do the assembly.

The fluff bot is ""a funny example but drives home the point that autonomy often doesn't generalize well, and so handling soft fluffy material that isn't as predictable as a rigid part was causing a huge problem,"" Aaron Johnson, a mechanical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said.

""Human hands are way better at doing that,"" Musk said.

The shift would put more emphasis on stores in less-costly suburban locations that can also provide repairs as the company works to meet Elon Musk's goal of improving service for existing customers, many of whom have complained of long delays, they said.

As part of that push, Tesla is looking to ramp up hiring of technicians and other staff for service jobs in China, one of the people said. Tesla's China recruitment website showed more than 300 openings for service jobs as of Thursday.

Musk said last week on Twitter, in response to a Tesla owner in Texas who complained that he had been waiting a month to get his vehicle fixed, that he had made ""advancing Tesla service to make it awesome"" a top priority.

Unlike mainstream automakers, Tesla owns all of its own stores, rather than relying on dealers. It also sells its cars online. That has allowed it more leeway to adjust a retail strategy that had been initially modeled on Apple's stores.

Tesla didn't immediately response to a request for comment.

The U.S. automaker sold 400,000 China-made Model 3 and Model Y cars in the first eight months of the year, with 60% of them sold locally, according to the China Passenger Car Association. That was 67% more than a year ago.

The change in Tesla's approach in China, where it has become the second-largest EV brand behind BYD (002594.SZ), would reflect a recognition that it has to build customer loyalty now that it has established its brand in the world's largest car market, one analyst said.

""It's not necessary to open showrooms in expensive shopping malls, especially when the repair business has become lucrative,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.

""It makes better sense to keep only one or two showrooms downtown to keep the brand positioning but move more to suburbs.”

Tesla opened its first store in central Beijing in 2013 and now has over 200 outlets across the country that display models and arrange test drives for potential buyers.

More than half of the stores, however, do not offer maintenance service since they are in high-rent locations where space is limited. That includes Tesla's first store in Beijing and its first store in Shanghai.

More than half of Tesla's showrooms in seven of China's biggest cities, including Shenzhen and Chengdu, are now in downtown areas, according to a Reuters count based on Tesla's China website.

Like other companies, Tesla has seen traffic in its stores heavily disrupted by China's tough approach to containing COVID-19, which has involved lockdowns of varying scope and duration, including in Shanghai where it has a factory.

Reuters could not determine how many urban showrooms Tesla was considering closing, how many new locations in fast-growing suburbs could be opened or what the cost of that shift would be.

The carmaker has been the target of a series of customer complaints and lawsuits in China, including a well-known case last year which saw an unhappy owner clamber atop a Tesla at the Shanghai auto show to protest the company's handling of her complaints about malfunctioning brakes.

The incident received significant attention in China and prompted state media outlets to criticise the company.

Tesla later apologised to Chinese consumers for not addressing the complaints in a timely manner and pledged to review its service operations.

Tesla's EV rivals in China have taken a mixed approach to retail distribution. Apart from self-run stores, BYD and Xpeng (9868.HK) also rely on third-party dealers.

Nio (9866.HK), like Tesla, has a network of high profile urban stores in China. It has also invested in door-to-door service, dispatching workers, many of whom were hired from the hotel industry, to pick up cars for repairs and drop them off when work is complete.

DETROIT, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk has set his young company on an aggressive expansion path like no other auto executive has dreamed - but one riddled with potholes and road blocks that could stall or sidetrack the journey.

Musk's audacious goal of selling 20 million electric vehicles in 2030 is at the center of the company's growth promise for shareholders and its pledge to drive the adoption of sustainable energy. If achieved, it would make Tesla twice the size of any automaker in history, accounting for roughly 20% of the global vehicle market.

But such exponential growth - a 13-fold increase over the estimated 1.5 million vehicles it hopes to sell this year - will come at an unprecedented cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, according to a Reuters analysis of Tesla's financial disclosures and forecasts for global electric vehicle demand, EV battery and battery mineral production.

""I'd equate this with the Manhattan Project in World War Two,"" said manufacturing expert Michael Tracy of The Agile Group, referring to the sweeping effort by the United States to build an atomic bomb.

Musk's vision poses staggering challenges to the 19-year-old Texas-based automaker, not the least of which is securing enough batteries and critical raw materials such as lithium and nickel to supply 20 million vehicles.

Tesla has been a disruptor, but this next phase of growth, if achieved, would go beyond disruption to fundamentally remake the global auto industry as well as the mining and trade of battery materials.

Along the way, Tesla would need to build seven or eight more ""gigafactories"" - an average of one every 12 months or so - take share from every competitor and emerge as a company the size of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) combined. It would also need about 30 times as much battery capacity to supply all of its vehicle factories. (See graphic, https://tmsnrt.rs/3CzDic4 )

The price tag will be steep: Tesla could spend an estimated $400 billion or more over the next eight years to build new vehicle assembly and battery plants around the globe, and another $200 billion or more to build or buy the batteries, including the cost of the raw materials.

Canada, Indonesia, India and other governments are already lobbying to win Tesla's next investment in EV production, an announcement Musk has said could come by the end of the year.

Producing 20 million vehicles a year would require Tesla to expand both its own battery-making capacity, and the capacity of its battery partners and the raw materials producers that supply them.

""Long-term, we're expecting to make on the order of 3,000 gigawatt hours or 3 terawatt hours per year,"" Musk told investors in July. ""I think we've got a good chance of achieving this actually before 2030, but I'm highly confident that we could do it by 2030.""

Tesla's current battery production capacity is 100 gigawatt-hours.

Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, which tracks the global EV battery industry, expects that Tesla will require 2.0 million tons of lithium, 1.3 million tons of nickel, 0.2 million tons of cobalt and 3.5 million tons of graphite to support production in 2030 of 3.0 terawatt-hours of battery production.

That is four times as much lithium and nickel, twice as much cobalt and seven times as much graphite as the entire EV industry expects to consume in 2022.

Benchmark describes the 2030 targets as ""highly ambitious.""

Tesla did not respond to a detailed request for comment.

The automaker, which rarely discloses its supplier relationships, began signing offtake agreements with miners and refiners more than a decade ago, according to former Tesla executives interviewed by Reuters, and currently has deals with more than 20 materials suppliers around the globe (See graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3PMZpPc )

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

The raw material capacity needed to support Tesla's planned production in 2030 does not exist today, experts say.

Musk's sales target also depends on factors beyond Tesla's control.

Rival automakers are fielding more electric vehicles to compete with Tesla's high-volume Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs.

In China, home-grown startups such as Xpeng Inc (9868.HK), , Nio Inc (9866.HK), and Li Auto Inc (2015.HK) trail Tesla in sales volume, but are growing rapidly.

China's BYD (002594.SZ), , which sells inexpensive electric and hybrid vehicles, is challenging Tesla globally, while Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O) have beaten Tesla to market with electric pickup trucks, a significant emerging segment in North America.

Mike Tracy is skeptical of Musk's ability to develop a global manufacturing juggernaut over the next eight years with nearly double the production capacity of Toyota, currently the world's largest automaker by volume.

""That would be an extraordinary achievement, considering it's taken Toyota decades to build that capability,"" he said.

SHANGHAI, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) completed a project to expand production capacity at its Shanghai plant on Monday, according to a statement on a Shanghai government platform for companies' environmental information disclosures.

Tesla will test the production lines for the upgrade during From Sept. 19 to Nov. 30, the statement added.

Reuters previously reported Tesla had been ramping up its output to reach a target of producing around 22,000 units of Model 3 and Model Y cars per week at the Shanghai plant.

Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The U.S. automaker planned to invest up to 1.2 billion yuan ($170 million) to expand production capacity at its Shanghai factory that would allow it to employ 4,000 more people at the site, state-backed Beijing Daily newspaper reported last November.

The project was originally expected to be finished in April, the Chinese media reported then.

REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) shares closed 2% lower on Thursday as a three-for-one stock split announced by the world's most valuable automaker to woo retail investors came into effect.

The stock opened at $302 and closed at $296.07 as the split allowed investors to get two additional shares for each they owned as of Aug. 17. It had closed at $891.29 before the split on Wednesday.

This is the second stock split by Tesla in as many years and follows similar moves by high-growth companies such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) to address the growing need to diversify investor base.

Stock splits ""certainly have a higher appeal to retail investors and makes their options more affordable as well,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley.

""Retail investors are a very important cohort for Tesla and today's stock split is an acknowledgment of that fact.""

Austin-based Tesla debuted in 2010 at $17 and in a decade surged to a peak price of $2,000, becoming one of the highest priced shares on Wall Street and making it difficult for small investors to bet on the high-growth stock.

The company decided to split its stock on a five-for-one basis in August 2020 and breached $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2021.

The EV maker is the sixth company in the S&P 500 index to split its shares this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P and Dow Jones indices.

Tesla's ticker was trending on social media stocktwits.com, indicating increased chatter among individual investors. The shares have lost about 11% of their value since March when the company announced plans to increase its number of shares.

""In typical buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news style, investors tend to drastically scale back purchases of splitting stocks in the weeks ensuing the effective split date, causing price momentum to slow,"" analysts at Vanda Research said in a note.

Tesla shares have risen to take the company's market cap to over $1 trillion since its previous split

A stock split does not affect the fundamentals of a company, but makes it easier for individual investors to do small trades. The benefits of such splits, however, are becoming less clear as brokerages let customers buy parts of a company's share.

Tesla's shares have fallen about 16% so far this year amid a selloff in high-growth stocks due to worries over aggressive interest rate hikes and geopolitical uncertainties.

SHANGHAI, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) sold 76,965 Chinese-made vehicles in August, nearly triple its sales from a month ago, as it quickened deliveries after ramping up output at its Shanghai plant.

The U.S. carmaker exported 42,463 Model 3s and Model Ys from China last month, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said. In July, it sold 28,217 vehicles and exported 19,756.

After a scheduled upgrade disrupted most production in July, Tesla ramped up output at the Shanghai plant in August, defying heatwaves and COVID curbs that hit its suppliers in the southwest region.

Battery maker CATL's (300750.SZ) Yibin plant, which mainly supplies battery cells to Tesla Shanghai, had to shut part of its operations due to local power restriction policies in mid-August. read more

The output ramp-up enabled Tesla to accelerate deliveries of the Model 3 and Model Y electric cars to customers especially in China, where it faces more competition from local rivals.

It slashed delivery waiting time for its two best-selling models to a maximum of 14 weeks in China, while buyers of the rear-wheel drive Model Y can pick up the SUV in a month after placing the order, according to Tesla's Chinese website.

China's overall passenger car sales in August jumped 28.4% from a year earlier to 1.9 million, the CPCA said.

After a difficult start to the year that has seen China's economy slow amid COVID lockdowns, auto sales in China have rebounded thanks to government incentives and tax breaks.

Exports of passenger vehicles jumped 77.5% last month, bucking an overall export growth slowdown, CPCA said.

Sales of electric cars accounted for 28% of the total in August and rose by 111.2%, it added.

BYD (002594.SZ) led the electric vehicle producers with 173,977 cars delivered in August, while Nio , Xpeng (9868.HK) and Li Auto (2015.HK) delivered 10,677, 9,578 and 4,571 vehicles, respectively.

Sept 13 (Reuters) - Auto parts supplier Aptiv Plc (APTV.N) said on Tuesday it would acquire a majority stake in a unit of Italy' Intercable for 595 million euros ($605.71 million), allowing the U.S. company access to technology used in electric vehicles (EVs).

Aptiv will own an 85% stake in the unit, Intercable Automotive Solutions, which manufactures high-voltage busbars that carry more electrical power than traditional cables. It has manufacturing facilities in Europe and Asia.

""Intercable Automotive Solutions is an excellent strategic fit with Aptiv's Signal & Power Solutions segment,"" Aptiv Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark said in a statement.

Aptiv, which counts Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N) as customers, in January announced a multi-billion-dollar deal for software developer Wind River to capitalize on the shift to software-oriented vehicles and diversify its revenue stream. read more

The deal also comes amid automakers' effort to replicate the success of Tesla's electric vehicles, as they replace 12-volt wiring systems with much higher voltage cables.

Aptiv's deal for Intercable Automotive is expected to close before the end of this year, following which the company will operate as a stand-alone business unit.

The transaction is expected to add to Aptiv's earnings next year. Shares of the company were down 2.7% amid a broader fall in market after data showed monthly U.S consumer prices unexpectedly rose in August.

Goldman Sachs & Co LLC served as financial adviser for the deal to Aptiv while Clifford Chance was the company's legal adviser.

Sept 14 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is suspending plans to make battery cells in Germany as it looks at qualify for electric vehicle and battery manufacturing tax breaks in the United States, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The electric vehicle maker has discussed moving equipment used to make cells to the United States, originally intended for use in the German factory, according to the report.

The Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed last month, provides electric vehicle makers that source batteries from within the United States with tax breaks.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The law also gives some buyers a $7,500 tax credit if they purchase EVs whose batteries meet certain sourcing requirements.

The company is looking to ramp up production of its electric vehicles at its new factories in Germany's Berlin and Austin, Texas to meet rising demand.

The manufacturing sector has been affected by soaring energy costs in Europe due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The geopolitical tension has also caused prices of materials used in batteries to rise.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Tesla's CEO Elon Musk is set to unveil its prototype humanoid robots at an event on Sept. 30, hoping to expand beyond self-driving cars that have not yet become reality despite his repeated promises.

While robots are widely used for specialist tasks at factories, other companies have struggled to create commercially viable human-like robots, despite decades-long development efforts.

""This market is very, very challenging market because you buy this big expensive robot, but it actually cannot do much,"" Heni Ben Amor, a robotics professor at Arizona State University, said.

TESLA

Tesla's humanoid robots, Optimus, will be initially used in manufacturing and logistics for boring and repetitive work, thus addressing a labor shortage.

For the longer term, Musk said the robot could be used in homes, even becoming a ""buddy"" or a ""catgirl"" sex partner. read more

HONDA

Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co’s (7267.T) Asimo bipedal robot had served as a face for the company but was not commercialized after more than two decades of development. Honda is now focusing on disaster relief robots and ""Avatar"" robots for tasks like remote surgery.

Honda aims to demonstrate the Avatar robot before early 2024 and deploy the machines in the 2030s.

GM-NASA

From 2007 to 2012, General Motors (GM.N) and NASA joined hands to develop humanoid robots, R2, for assembly and space exploration.

NASA said that they are not under development anymore. NASA said its current focus is the development of next-generation humanoid robots that can be used on the lunar surface and eventually on Mars.

HYUNDAI MOTOR-BOSTON DYNAMICS

Boston Dynamics created internet buzz with videos of its humanoid robots running, jumping, backflipping and dancing. But the loss-making U.S. company changed hands several times, with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, SoftBank (9984.T) and then Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) becoming the company's owner.

Hyundai and Boston Dynamics said in August that they will initially invest more than $400 million in a ""research-first organization"" on AI and robotics.

FORD-AGILITY ROBOTICS

In 2020, Ford (F.N) bought two humanoid robots, Digit, from Agility Robotics, to test the delivery of a package to doorstop from a delivery vehicle.

Oregon-based startup Agility Robotics is also working to deploy human-like robots that can pick up and move items at warehouses.

SOFTBANK, OTHERS

SoftBank’s wide-eyed Pepper robot, which helped burnish Chief Executive Masayoshi Son’s image as a forward-looking tech entrepreneur, saw production halted.

Several robot startups like Rethink Robotics also went out of business, as they failed to commercialize their products.

NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The $258 billion racketeering lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of running a pyramid scheme to support the cryptocurrency Dogecoin has expanded, adding seven new investor plaintiffs and six new defendants including his tunnel construction business Boring Co.

According to an amended complaint filed on Tuesday night in Manhattan federal court, Musk, his electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), his space tourism company SpaceX, Boring and others intentionally drove up the price of Dogecoin more than 36,000% over two years and then let it crash.

By doing so, the defendants ""profited tens of billions of dollars"" at other Dogecoin investors' expense, while knowing all along that the currency lacked intrinsic value and that its value ""depended solely on marketing,"" the complaint said.

The original lawsuit was filed in June. read more

Shortly afterward, Musk, the world's richest person, tweeted that he would ""keep supporting Dogecoin,"" and in an interview said ""people that work around the factory at SpaceX or Tesla"" asked him for that support, the amended complaint said.

Other new defendants include the Dogecoin Foundation, which calls itself a nonprofit providing governance and support for Dogecoin. It could not immediately be reached for comment.

The $258 billion in damages is triple the estimated decline in Dogecoin's market value since May 2021.

That was around the time Musk, playing a fictitious financial expert on a ""Weekend Update"" segment of NBC's ""Saturday Night Live,"" called Dogecoin ""a hustle.""

Dogecoin traded at about 6 cents on Wednesday, down from around 74 cents in May 2021.

Aug 31 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) will boost its planned investment in a new U.S. battery plant from $1.29 billion to $3.8 billion, partly in response to rising consumer demand for electric vehicles, the company said on Wednesday.

Battery maker Panasonic (6752.T) will be a partner in the Liberty, North Carolina, plant through its Prime Planet Energy & Solutions (PPES) joint venture with Toyota, according to Norm Bafunno, senior vice president of powertrain manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America.

The Liberty plant is slated to open in 2025. PPES will provide expertise in battery making technology and equipment, Bafunno said in an interview.

Panasonic also has a joint battery making venture with Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) in Nevada and recently announced plans to build a $4 billion plant in Kansas that is expected to supply Tesla and other automakers.

When Toyota announced the initial $1.29 billion investment last fall, North Carolina said the state would boost reimbursement to Toyota by $315 million if the company's investment topped $3 billion. read more

Toyota now plans to add two production lines dedicated to making batteries for fully electric vehicles at the Liberty plant, in addition to the four lines initially planned to make smaller batteries for hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius, Bafunno said. He declined to provide the plant's planned production capacity.

Initially, Bafunno added, the plant will make lithium-ion batteries using relatively conventional electrode technology - a mixture of nickel, cobalt and manganese for the cathode and graphite for the anode. But newer technologies, including solid state electrolytes, could be introduced over time.

“This technology is going to evolve quickly,” Bafunno said.

The higher investment figure for the Liberty plant follows the recent passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which provides incentives for manufacturers and tax credits to consumers aimed at boosting local content in EVs and batteries. read more

The car, which shares the Equinox name with a gasoline-burning Chevrolet compact utility vehicle, is one of three new EVs GM has said it plans to launch that season for the brand in North America.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has focused on the Equinox as an ""affordable"" electric SUV with a starting price of about $30,000, less than half the starting price of Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) Model Y.

In a statement, Barra said the Equinox showed GM could offer electric vehicles ""at nearly every price point and for every purpose.""

However, the first electric Equinox will be a limited edition 2RS model with an estimated range of 300 miles priced above $30,000, Chevrolet said. The $30,000 1LT version will be launched later.

The electric Equinox models will be assembled in Mexico.

BEIJING, Aug 27 (Reuters) - China's CATL (300750.SZ) is working on new battery materials that can improve energy density by 10% to 20% compared to iron phosphate batteries, the company's chairman said, as the battery giant scrambles to retain its top position amid competition.

The new material technology known as M3P can enable an electric vehicle to run 700 km (430 miles) per charge combined with CATL's next generation of battery pack technology, Zeng Yuqun said at the World New Energy Vehicle Congress in Beijing on Saturday.

The new materials will also lower the costs compared to nickel and cobalt-based batteries, he added.

Zeng, however, didn't say what metals M3P batteries will use or when mass production could start.

CATL, whose clients include Tesla(TSLA.O), Volkswagen(VOWG_p.DE), BMW(BMWG.DE) and Ford(F.N), is the world's biggest battery maker accounting for more than a third of the sales of batteries for electric vehicles (EV) worldwide.

It aims to increase the lead over rivals such as LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) and BYD by accelerating expansions globally and innovation in new battery technologies.

Wan Gang, Vice Chairman of China's national advisory body for policy making, said the global market size of EV batteries is expected to reach $250 billion by 2030, with demand exceeding 3.5 terrawatt hours. read more

CATL said in a separate announcement on Saturday that it will supply Qilin batteries with its latest battery pack technology to power Geely Automobile Holdings 's Zeekr cars due to hit the market in early 2023.

CALT launched the Qilin battery in June and touted a 13% higher energy density compared to the same size of pack of Tesla's 4680 cylindrical battery cells-- denoting 46 millimetres in diameter and 80 millimetres in length, while using same type of materials.

The sources requested anonymity ahead of an official announcement. Twitter and representatives for Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Shareholders were widely expected to vote in favor after a stock market downturn made Musk's $54.20-per-share deal for Twitter, which was signed in April, look pricey in the current environment. Twitter shares are now hovering around $41.

Earlier on Monday, Twitter said payments made to a whistleblower did not breach any terms of its sale to Musk, after the world's richest man made another attempt to scrap the deal.

Twitter's lawyers said Musk's reasons for wanting to back out of the deal were ""invalid and wrongful.""

Last week, lawyers for Musk said Twitter's failure to seek his consent before paying $7.75 million to whistleblower Peiter Zatko and his lawyers violated the merger agreement, which restricts when Twitter could make such payments.

Zatko, who was fired by Twitter in January as the company's security head, accused the social media firm last month of falsely claiming it had a solid security plan and making misleading statements about its defenses against hackers and spam accounts.

The whistleblower will meet the U.S. Senate Judiciary committee on Tuesday to discuss the allegations.

""With the Musk camp now being allowed to include the Zatko claims in its testimony for Delaware, tomorrow's hearing will be closely watched by the Street,"" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note.

The Twitter vs Musk trial is scheduled to start on Oct. 17 in Delaware Chancery Court.

Lawyers for Musk, who is also CEO of electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), were not immediately available for comment.

HONG KONG, Aug 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chinese electric-car maker BYD (1211.HK), (002594.SZ) doesn’t need Warren Buffett. The 92-year-old billionaire’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) has sold a sliver read more of its 7.73% stake in the Hong Kong- and Shenzhen-listed electric-car maker. That trims its holding in BYD's H-shares to 19.92% from 20.49%. Investors are nonetheless rattled: shares fell more than 10% on Wednesday in Hong Kong. But founder Wang Chuanfu has engineered a company that could ride out Buffett’s departure, and worse.

A brutal combination read more ]of Beijing’s zero-Covid policies, war in Ukraine, semiconductor shortages and U.S.-China tensions have shaken supply chains. Set against that backdrop, shareholders might fear the Oracle of Omaha is getting out while he can. Even before the latest selloff, BYD’s Hong Kong stock was down some 16% since July on speculation of an exit.

That’s unfair. Buffett’s roughly $7.5 billion stake is worth around 33 times the $8 per share he paid when the deal closed in 2009; annualised returns of more than 30% eclipse the Hong Kong benchmark index’s 3.5% over the same 13-year period. It’s a good time to cash out. Meanwhile, BYD has matured into a formidable rival to Tesla (TSLA.O) and other more established automakers at home.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Wang’s decision to go all-in on vertical integration proved prescient. Investments into everything from lithium to chips gave the group an edge in tough times, allowing it to secure components for its own production lines. It has even started to supply batteries to competitors from Daimler (MBGn.DE) to Ford Motor (F.N).

Sales are on a roll too. The carmaker tripled deliveries of electric vehicles to 641,350 in the first half of 2022 from a year earlier. New hybrid powertrains — coupling a battery with a traditional motor — sold well, while pricier new models aimed at taking the brand upmarket also impressed. That helped to more than double net profit to 3.9 billion yuan ($566 million).

New hazards are emerging, however. Fraught relations between Washington and Beijing could slow sales growth overseas and to foreign clients. Geopolitics could derail a mooted battery-supply deal with Tesla, for example, or jeopardise ties with American automaker Ford. Collaboration with Huawei, blacklisted by U.S. authorities, could also draw unwanted attention as the company expands.

Even so, Wang’s impressive track record suggests he will be able to navigate what comes next – with or without Buffett.

CONTEXT NEWS

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has sold 1.33 million Hong Kong-listed shares of electric-car and battery maker BYD for about HK$370 million (US$47 million), according to a filing on Aug. 30, reducing its stake in BYD's total issued H shares to 19.92% from 20.49%.

Buffett's company had acquired 225 million BYD shares in 2008, giving it a 7.73% stake, equal to the 20.49% stake in H shares. Berkshire paid $232 million for its shares, whose value had by Aug. 30 grown to about $7.5 billion.

The Aug. 30 filing is the first confirmation that Berkshire has reduced its BYD investment since a 20.49% stake entered Hong Kong's Central Clearing and Settlement System on July 11, with Citigroup serving as custodian.

BYD’s Hong Kong-listed shares fell by as much as 11% to HK$31.00 in morning trade on Aug. 31.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Sept 1 (Reuters) - China has said that automakers must apply for licences to collect geographic data using sensors on their intelligent vehicles, highlighting Beijing's security concerns about the growing sophistication of smart cars' mapping capabilities.

The statement, a clarification of China's surveying and mapping law, reflects regulators efforts to prevent any scenario where highly-detailed visual data collected by smart cars could fall into the hands of hostile foreign actors.

The rules, effective since publication, could further complicate the local operations of foreign companies like Tesla (TSLA.O), which already have to seek partnerships with Chinese firms when it comes to collecting and processing such data.

Automakers and developers of autonomous driving software should either apply for mapping licences or ask a licensed company to collect, store, transform and process geographic data, according to the statement published on Tuesday by the Ministry of Natural Resources.

The official newspaper of the ministry said that the rapid development of China's intelligent and connected vehicle industry meant a ""safety bottom line"" had to be drawn for the ""real-time high-precision coordinates, high-definition images and other data support"" on which it is highly dependent.

The global market for the intelligent and connected vehicle industry is projected to reach $470 billion in 2030, Wan Gang, vice-chairman of China's national policy-making advisory body, told a conference in Beijing on Saturday.

Vehicles such as self-driving cars need to collect large amounts of geographical data in order to create high-precision maps that are essential for accurate and safe navigation.

China has so far issued mapping licences to more than 20 companies including search engine giant Baidu (9888.HK) and Tencent-backed mapping company Navinfo (002405.SZ).

WILMINGTON, Del., Sept 15 (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk accused Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) of fraud by concealing serious flaws in the social media company's data security, which the entrepreneur said should allow him to end his $44 billion deal for the company, according to a Thursday court filing.

Musk, the world's richest person, amended his previously filed lawsuit by adopting allegations by a Twitter whistleblower, who told Congress on Tuesday of meddling on the influential social media platform by foreign agents. read more

The chief executive of electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) also alleged that Twitter hid from him that it was not complying with a 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission regarding user data.

""Needless to say, the newest revelations make undeniably clear that the Musk Parties have the full right to walk away from the Merger Agreement -- for numerous independently sufficient reasons,"" said the amended countersuit.

Musk said the claims by the whistleblower, former head of Twitter security Peiter ""Mudge"" Zatko, amounted to fraud and breach of contract by Twitter.

Musk has asked a Delaware judge to find that he was not obligated to close the deal while Twitter wants the judge to order Musk to buy the company for $54.20 per share. A five-day trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 17.

Twitter shares were up 0.6% in late Thursday trading.

Twitter has said it conducted an internal investigation of Zatko's allegations and determined they lacked merit. The company has said Zatko was fired for poor performance.

Twitter's lawyers have said in court that the whistleblower claims that Musk folded into his case were either not grounds for terminating the deal agreement or failed to meet the standard for fraud.

Sept 20 (Reuters) - Rental car company Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ.O) plans to order up to 175,000 General Motors Co(GM.N) electric vehicles over the next five years, its latest move toward zero-emission models.

The multi-billion dollar, multi-year deal could be the first of many GM agreements to supply electric vehicles to rental car companies, said Steve Carlisle, the automaker's North American operations chief, on a conference call.

""It's an enormous first step,"" Carlisle said, adding that GM is in talks about similar deals with other rental car companies.

GM shares fell more than 5% Tuesday afternoon following rival Ford Motor Co's warning late Monday that supply chain costs were $1 billion higher than expected in the third quarter. Ford shares were down more than 11%. read more

Automakers have cut reliance on low-profit, bulk sales to rental car agencies as supply chain problems curtailed production. Carlisle said GM expects to deliver electric vehicles to Hertz at close to retail profit margins.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a statement ""each rental experience will further increase purchase consideration for our products and drive growth for our company.""

GM aims to have capacity to build 1 million EVs annually in North America by 2025. Carlisle said the sales to Hertz fits within that previously announced goal.

Such deals would ease pressure on GM to hit EV sales targets through individual customer sales, a market dominated by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Hertz's current goal is for one-quarter of its fleet to be electric by the end of 2024. In April, Hertz said it would buy up to 65,000 electric vehicles over five years from EV maker Polestar, a joint venture between China's Geely and its Swedish Volvo unit. In October 2021, Hertz announced plans to purchase 100,000 Tesla electric cars, primarily the Model 3.

The GM deal ""spans a wide range of vehicle categories and price points — from compact and midsize SUVs to pickups, luxury vehicles,"" the companies said.

The first GM electric vehicles to ship to Hertz will be Chevrolet Bolt models starting early next year, Carlisle said.

GM expects Hertz to deploy many of its EVs in Los Angeles and San Francisco, helping to meet California electric vehicle quotas. Hertz Senior Vice President Jeff Nieman said the company plans to offer EVs across its network, with priority to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Orlando.

Hertz estimated customers could travel more than 8 billion miles in these EVs and save about 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions versus gasoline-powered vehicles.

NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower for a third straight session on Tuesday as a rise in job openings fueled fears the U.S. Federal Reserve has another reason to maintain its aggressive path of interest rate hikes to combat inflation.

The benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX) has tumbled more than 5% since Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday reaffirmed the central bank's determination to raise interest rates even in the face of a slowing economy. read more

Labor demand showed no signs of cooling as U.S. job openings rose to 11.239 million in July and the prior month was revised sharply higher. A separate report showed consumer confidence rebounded strongly in August after three straight monthly declines. read more

""It locks them in even further.""

The data increases the focus on the August non-farm payrolls data due on Friday.

New York Fed President John Williams said on Tuesday the central bank will likely need to get its policy rate about 3.5% and is unlikely to cut interest rates at all next year as it fights inflation. read more

However, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in an essay published on Tuesday the Fed could ""dial back"" from its recent string of 75 basis point hikes if new data shows inflation is ""clearly"" slowing. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the Fed's pledge to bring inflation down to its 2% goal will not necessarily result in a severe recession. read more

Rate-sensitive megacap growth and technology stocks such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), down 0.85%, and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), off 1.53%, were among the biggest drags on the benchmark index.

NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended a directionless session higher on Wednesday as an on-target inflation report largely stanched the flow of Tuesday's sell-off and investors pressed the ""pause"" button.

All three indexes wavered throughout the day, but ultimately ended in positive territory. They all failed to meaningfully recover ground lost in Tuesday's carnage, which wrought their largest percentage plunges in more than two years.

""Today is a lick-your-wounds day, after taking body blows yesterday,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska. ""It’s a day of rest and that’s somewhat of a welcome sign.""

""The inflation debate continues and yesterday was a harsh reminder that this a tough battle and the Fed needs to remain aggressive to put a lid on the widespread inflationary prices we’re seeing,"" Detrick added.

The PPI report offered reassurance that inflation is indeed on a slow, downward trajectory.

Inflation

But it still has a long way to go before it approaches the Federal Reserve's average annual 2% inflation target, and while financial markets have fully priced in an interest rate hike of at least 75 basis points at the conclusion of the FOMC's policy meeting next week, they see a 22% likelihood of a super-sized, 100 basis-point increase, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

Two-year U.S. Treasury yields, which reflect interest rate expectations, extended Tuesday's rise.

The size and duration of further interest rate hikes going forward have many market observers concerned over the lagging effects of the Fed's tightening phase, with some viewing recession as unavoidable.

The transportation sector (.DJT), seen as a barometer of economic health and which provides a glimpse into the supply side of the inflation picture, was weighed down by rail stocks in the face of a potential strike.

""Does the White House really want rails to shut down and impact supply chains even more, less than two months before midterm elections?"" Detrick asked. ""We're optimistic they can keep rails open.""

Railroad operators Union Pacific (UNP.N), Norfolk Southern (NSC.N) and CSX Corp (CSX.O) lost 3.7%, 2.2% and 1.0% respectively, even as Labor Secretary Marty Walsh met with union representatives in Washington in talks aimed at preventing a rail shutdown. read more

PARIS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Dacia, the low-cost brand of French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA), plans to stick to thermal engines for as long as it can while the rest of the group bets strongly on going electric, Chief Executive Denis Le Vot told Reuters.

While Renault plans to go fully electric in 2030, Dacia will retain the possibility of making the big jump only by 2035, when fossil fuel engines will be banned in Europe, Le Vot said in the interview, adding that would help hedge the group's electric vehicle push.

""Each has its role to play. Renault will push to be the champion of electric engines, this has a risk,"" Le Vot said on the sidelines of a presentation in Le Bourget near Paris. ""This is also why Dacia exists.""

""Depending on how fast the market converts to electric engines and of clients' appetite, Dacia is here. The two can co-exist in an intimate fashion,"" he said.

Dacia has only one electric model, Dacia Spring, which accounts for 12% of its order intakes.

While it continues to bank on small engines powered by fossil fuel and liquefied petroleum gas, which make up a third of the brand's sales, Dacia plans to offer a first hybrid model in 2023.

Renault, which was a pioneer along with alliance partner Nissan (7201.T) in the electric car engines sector a decade ago, has recently been dethroned by newcomers such as Tesla (TSLA.O).

In a bid to rebound, Renault will unveil later this year its plan to create separate divisions for electric and combustion engine vehicles.

Sept 20 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's (F.N) stock tumbled over 12% on Tuesday in its deepest one-day decline in over a decade after the automaker said inflation-related costs would be $1 billion more than expected in the current quarter and that parts shortages had delayed deliveries.

The stock ended at $13.09, making its percentage decline for the session its largest since January 2011.

Ford's preliminary third-quarter results, released late on Monday, sent shares of rival General Motors Co (GM.N)down 5.6% as analysts said it might take more time for automakers to recover from chip shortages.

Ford's inflation troubles and FedEx's weak demand highlight the bind the Federal Reserve finds itself in ahead of the U.S. central bank's policy-making meeting on Wednesday.

The Fed is widely expected to hike rates by 75 basis points in its battle against decades-high inflation. Its aggressive monetary policy campaign has battered the U.S. stock market in recent weeks, with investors worried the Fed's measures could hobble the economy.

Ford also estimated it would have 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles in inventory lacking parts.

Ford, which is set to report third-quarter results on Oct. 26, affirmed 2022 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes forecast of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.

It was unclear if chip and parts supply will normalize by the end of the year, Deutsche Bank's Rosner said.

Ford's shares are down 37% in 2022, well over the S&P 500's (.SPX) 19% decrease.

Self-declared ""car guy"" Biden climbed into a silver electric Cadillac SUV and an orange Corvette, glad-handed with the industry's union workers and declared the city, the birthplace of the auto industry, was making a comeback.

Detroit's auto show is the largest in North America and a key stop on Democrat Biden's stepped-up midterm election travel agenda, as he showcases new laws to fund infrastructure and give consumers grants to buy EVs.

""We're choosing to build a better America, an America that is confronting the climate crisis, with America's workers leading the way,"" Biden said in a speech at the show.

The president was introduced by local auto union worker Ryan Buchalski, who said the president was ""kicking ass for the working class.""

Biden announced the approval of the first $900 million in U.S. funding to build EV charging stations in 35 states, part of a $1 trillion infrastructure law approved last November.

When he served as vice president in the Obama administration, Biden attended the Detroit auto show as a strong advocate of the 2008-09 bailouts of General Motors Co (GM.N) and Chrysler, which is now part of Stellantis NV (STLA.MI).

Now Detroit's Big Three automakers - GM, Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Chrysler - are showing off new EVs at the car show, as Congress and Biden pledge tens of billions of dollars in loans, manufacturing and consumer tax credits and grants to speed the transition away from internal combustion vehicles to cleaner EVs.

The ""great American Road Trip is going to be fully electrified,"" Biden declared.

In August 2021, Biden set a goal that EVs or plug-in hybrid vehicles represent 50% of all U.S. new vehicle sales by 2030. The Detroit Three back the nonbinding goal of 50%, but Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) dominates the U.S. electric vehicle market and outsells the Detroit automakers combined on EVs.

U.S. sales of EVs jumped 83% last year, but represent a meager 3% of the market, and gasoline-powered trucks were well-represented at the exhibition.

NEW EV FACTORIES

White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi told Reuters that automakers and battery firms in 2022 announced ""$13 billion into EV manufacturing"" as they accelerate ""the pace of their investment into capital projects here in the United States.""

In July, the U.S. Energy Department said it plans to lend Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture of GM and LG Energy Solution (373220.KS), $2.5 billion to help finance construction of new lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facilities.

Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) recently announced it will build a new $4.4 billion lithium-ion battery plant for U.S. EVs with Korean battery supplier LG Energy Solution Ltd.

Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said it will boost its planned investment in a new U.S. battery plant from $1.29 billion to $3.8 billion.

GM and LG Energy Solution in August began production at their $2.3 billion joint-venture battery production plant in Ohio. The companies are considering a site in New Carlisle, Indiana, for a fourth U.S. battery cell manufacturing plant expected to cost around $2.4 billion.

""I believe we can own the future of the automobile market. I believe we can own the future of manufacturing,"" Biden said. ""American manufacturing is back. Detroit is back. America's back, and folks, we're proving it's never, ever, ever a good bet to bet against the American people.""

Peiter ""Mudge"" Zatko, a famed hacker who served as Twitter's head of security until his firing in January, said some Twitter employees were concerned the Chinese government would be able to collect data on the company's users.

Twitter has come under fire previously for lax security, most notably in 2020 when teenage hackers seized control of dozens of high-profile accounts, including the verified profile of former U.S. President Barack Obama.

On Tuesday, Zatko's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed Twitter's security issues could be far more serious, alleging for the first time that the company was informed of agents of the Chinese government working at the social media firm.

Still, shares of Twitter rose almost 1% amid a sharp market selloff. The stock moves almost exclusively based on sentiment about whether billionaire Elon Musk will be forced to complete his $44 billion deal to buy the company, and the Tuesday gain suggested investors did not see any new details that could favor Musk's effort to abandon the deal.

And while Grassley, a Republican, wondered how Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal would keep his job if the allegations were true, many senators used the testimony to support legislation they had introduced to rein in the market power of Big Tech, with a few calling for immediate direct action against Twitter.

The allegations of a Chinese agent will pose a continuing public relations nightmare for Twitter, and investors will demand to know more, said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.

During his testimony, Zatko referenced a Reuters story on Tuesday that detailed internal clashes between some teams that wanted to maximize the advertising revenue opportunity from Chinese advertisers and others who were concerned about doing business inside China amid rising geopolitical tensions. read more

""This was a big internal conundrum,"" Zatko said, adding the company was reluctant to turn away from China as the fastest- growing overseas market for ad revenue.

""In a nutshell, if we were already in bed, it would be problematic if we lost that revenue stream,"" he said.

Zatko said on Tuesday that in the week before he was fired from Twitter, he learned the FBI told the company an agent of China's Ministry of State Security, or MSS, the country's main espionage agency, was on the payroll at Twitter.

A Twitter spokesperson said the hearing ""only confirms that Mr. Zatko's allegations are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies.""

The spokesperson added that Twitter's hiring process is independent of foreign influence and access to data is managed through background checks and monitoring and detection systems.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Read More

Zatko said on Tuesday he recalled a conversation with another Twitter executive about concerns that a foreign agent was inside the company. The executive responded ""Well, since we already have one, what does it matter if we have more?""

LITIGATION AGAINST MUSK

Grassley noted that Agrawal refused to appear at the hearing for fear it could jeopardize the company's litigation against Elon Musk, who is also the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O). Twitter and Musk head to trial next month over whether the billionaire's takeover deal should be completed.

Twitter shareholders approved Musk’s buyout of the company, Twitter said on Tuesday after a virtual special meeting of stockholders.

The San Francisco-based company sued Musk for terminating the agreement, while Musk countersued, accusing Twitter of misrepresenting the number of false and spam accounts on its service.

Little of what Zatko said appeared to be particularly helpful for getting Musk out of the deal, according to Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane University Law School.

The deal contract excludes legislative changes that Congress might adopt and Zatko said fines by the FTC are priced into the business. Lipton said that suggests regulatory action against Twitter will not rise to the level of a material event that could nullify the deal agreement.

The lack of evidence to support Zatko's claims that Twitter did not have sufficient controls for spam bots also will not help Musk's legal team, which has used the issue in an attempt to end the deal, Ives said.

A Delaware judge ruled last week that Musk may include Zatko's whistleblower claims in his case against Twitter, but denied his request to delay the trial. read more

The Senate committee questioned Zatko over his claims that Twitter misled regulators about its compliance with a 2011 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over improper handling of user data.

Since then, Twitter has made ""little meaningful progress on basic security, integrity and privacy systems,"" Zatko's complaint filed with regulators in July said.

Zatko's whistleblower complaint appeared to contain over two pages of links to supporting documents, such as emails between Zatko and Agrawal and an assessment of misinformation and disinformation on Twitter.

The number of documents was limited compared with those provided by Facebook (META.O) whistleblower Frances Haugen, who released thousands of pages of internal material.

NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Tuesday, the first session after the U.S. Labor Day holiday and summer vacations, as traders assessed fresh economic data in volatile trading.

A survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed the U.S. services industry picked up in August for the second straight month amid stronger order growth and employment, while supply bottlenecks and price pressures eased. read more

However, numbers from S&P Global showed the services sector Purchasing Managers' Index fell short of flash estimates for August.

A stronger-than-expected reading on the U.S. services sector fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates to tame inflation.

""The Fed has relegated us to being very data dependent, so every piece of information that comes out investors are going to look not only at the absolute level, but try to infer what that means for when the Fed meets,"" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.

""One of the things that is disconcerting to investors is that there's really little to propel markets either up solidly or down solidly,"" she added.

Concerns over the supply of energy to Europe and how COVID-19 lockdowns will impact China's economy also drove markets down on Tuesday, said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""A lot of uncertainty and volatility is not coming from the U.S.; it's actually coming from overseas.""

The focus will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Thursday as well U.S. consumer price data next week for clues on the path of monetary policy.

Markets started September on a weak note, extending a slide that started at the end of August, as hawkish comments from Fed policymakers and data signaling U.S. economicmomentum raised fears of aggressive interest rate hikes.

The S&P is down nearly 18% so far this year, while the Nasdaq has shed over 26% as rising interest rates hurt megacap technology and growth stocks.

Among the major S&P sectors, energy (.SPNY) and communication services (.SPLRCL) were the worst performers, while defensive utilities (.SPLRCU) and real estate (.SPLRCR) rose.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 173.14 points, or 0.55%, to 31,145.3; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 16.07 points, or 0.41%, to 3,908.19; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 85.96 points, or 0.74%, to 11,544.91.

Sept 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes ended a seesaw session higher on Monday, as investors turned their attention to this week's policy meeting at the Federal Reserve and how aggressively it will hike interest rates.

Even more so than the Ukraine war or corporate earnings, the actions of the U.S. central bank are driving market sentiment as traders try to position themselves for a rising interest rate environment.

The S&P 500 (.SPX) and the Nasdaq (.IXIC) rebounded from logging their worst weekly percentage drop since June on Friday, as markets fully priced in at least a 75 basis point rise in rates at the end of Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting, with Fed funds futures showing a 15% chance of a whopping 100 bps increase.

Unexpectedly hot August inflation data last week also raised bets on increased rate hikes down the road, with the terminal rate for U.S. fed funds now at 4.46%.

""This is all about what's going to happen on Wednesday, and what comes out of the Fed's hands on Wednesday, so I think people are just going to wait and see until then,"" said Josh Markman, partner at Bel Air Investment Advisors.

""We had a poor print when the CPI came in, so the Fed - who is behind the 8-ball - is now trying to get ahead of the curve and curb inflation, and that (awareness) is driving equity markets.""

Reflecting the caution for new bets ahead of the Fed meeting, just 9.58 million shares traded on U.S. exchanges on Monday, the sixth lightest day for trading volume this year.

Focus will also be on new economic projections, due to be published alongside the Fed's policy statement at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. read more

WILMINGTON, Del., Sept 6 (Reuters) - A trial over Elon Musk's bid to end his $44 billion deal for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) should be delayed by several weeks to allow the billionaire to investigate a whistleblower's claims about security on the social media platform, Musk's lawyer told a judge on Tuesday.

""Doesn't justice demand a few weeks to look into this?"" said Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, at a hearing in Wilmington, Delaware.

Last month, whistleblower allegations became public that provided Musk, the world's richest person, fresh ammunition to bolster what legal experts said was a long-shot attempt to walk away from the deal without paying a $1 billion termination fee.

Twitter's former head of security, Peiter Zatko, a famed hacker known as ""Mudge,"" said in a complaint to regulators that the company falsely represented that it had a solid data security plan. read more

Twitter has dismissed Zatko's allegations as a ""false narrative"" and its lawyer accused the billionaire on Tuesday of seizing on the whistleblower allegations to cover up the fact that he supposedly rushed in to buying the company without assessing the risks.

""Mr. Musk is blaming Twitter for his failing to do customary due diligence,"" said William Savitt, an attorney for Twitter. He urged the judge to prevent Musk from adding whistleblower claims to his lawsuit but said if allowed, the five-day trial should begin on Oct. 17 as scheduled.

Savitt read an early May message from Musk to a banker that turned up in the litigation in which the billionaire wrote ""it won't make sense to buy Twitter if we're heading into World War III."" Savitt said it was evidence that Musk is looking for any way out of the deal and his initial claims about bots and fake accounts were merely a pretext to end the deal.

Twitter and Musk have sued each other. The company wants Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery to order Musk to buy the company for the $54.20 per share he agreed to in April.

Shares of Twitter ended Tuesday trading at $38.65 per share, up slightly.

McCormick ended Tuesday's hearing without saying when she would rule.

Musk, who is also chief executive of electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), initially countersued Twitter for misleading him about the amount of fake or bot accounts on the platform, which he said allowed him to walk away from the deal.

BERLIN, Sept 9 (Reuters) - BMW will power its new class of electric vehicles to be released in 2025 with cylindrical battery cells made in six factories by partners including China's CATL and EVE Energy as the carmaker looks to speed up charging and extend driving range.

The German carmaker has already placed multibillion-euro orders with CATL (300750.SZ) and EVE (300014.SZ) to produce battery cells at four factories in China and Europe, it said on Friday, adding it was seeking partners able to build two more factories in the United States and Mexico.

BMW said it would sign contracts for up to 20 gigawatt hours of capacity at each of the six plants.

CATL said in a separate statement on Friday that it would have two of its plants supply BMW with batteries that have the same diameter as Tesla's 4680 cells.

The German automaker didn't say how many batteries it plans to procure from EVE and CATL.

By adopting cylindrical cells, BMW (BMWG.DE) is breaking from the prismatic cells it has so far used in its batteries, following the path chosen by Tesla (TSLA.O) with its 4680 cylindrical battery.

BMW's new generation of batteries will use more nickel and silicon and less cobalt, leading to a 20% increase in energy density, 30% faster charging and a 30% longer range than previous generations.

A spokesperson for CATL, which has supplied BMW for a decade and is looking at potential battery factory sites in the United States, told Reuters in May it would begin supplying cylindrical cells to BMW from 2025, but the carmaker declined to comment at the time. read more

The news also confirmed a Reuters report in August that EVE, which supplies BMW in China, had signed a contract for cylindrical cells with the German carmaker. read more

The shift by BMW underscores growing momentum for larger-format cylindrical batteries.

Prismatic batteries, which are rectangular in shape, have become the most common form of auto battery in the past two years as they can be more densely packed, saving on costs.

But proponents of cylindrical batteries argue the newer larger format cells have become more cost-effective due to improvements in energy density.

Analysts attribute rise to oversold condition

Sept 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, with the major indexes recording their first weekly gain in four weeks as investors went on a buying spree, shrugging off concerns about the economic outlook.

The gains followed a sharp sell-off that began in mid-August, triggered by concerns about the impact of tighter monetary policies and signs of an economic slowdown in Europe and China.

Analysts said this week's market recovery was more related to previous overselling as uncertainty remained high about inflation and the Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in interest rate hikes.

""It's not surprising we get a little bit of a bounce like we're getting here, as a lot of this is technical,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist and portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.

""I wouldn't be shocked if we started the week off with a little bit more strength and then we sort of settle down and give back a little bit as we get ready for the CPI,"" he added, looking ahead to next week.

Investors awaited August's consumer prices (CPI) report on Tuesday for any signs that inflation may be easing. It is expected to show that prices rose at an 8.1% pace over the year in August, compared with 8.5% in July.

Wells Fargo economists expect headline inflation to log its steepest monthly decline since the peak of the pandemic in April 2020, helped by a pullback in gas prices.

All 11 major S&P sectors traded higher on Friday, with communication services (.SPLRCL), technology (.SPLRCT), energy (.SPNY) and consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) leading the way.

Hammered since the beginning of the year over concerns about higher interest rates, high-growth stocks rose in the week.

Investors are jittery about the prospects of another outsized interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. On Friday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the Fed should be aggressive with rate hikes while the economy ""can take a punch,"" while Kansas City Fed President Esther George said taming inflation could be a tough task. read more

Summary Companies GM to launch direct-to-customer sales channel in China

New wholly owned channel to be called Durant Guild

GM to target rich urban consumers with niche U.S. imports

High-end SUVs and sports cars the most likely imports

BEIJING, Sept 8 (Reuters) - General Motors has lost its mojo in China.

Sales of its flagship Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet brands have slumped by a third over the past five years to 1.3 million cars a year as consumers snap up smart EVs made by home-grown firms such as Xpeng (9868.HK), Nio (9866.HK) and BYD .

To generate some buzz around its American brands, GM (GM.N) is planning to target well-heeled consumers in China's megacities with niche, luxury imports, executives at the U.S. automaker told Reuters.

Using a new direct sales platform called Durant Guild, the company will host invitation-only events to showcase possible products, open ""experience centers"" in urban hubs and potentially stage pop-ups at selected sites, they said.

""Durant Guild is not a volume play, but if we do a good job and the products sell well, it will create a lot of buzz around Cadillac and Chevy and will help how people perceive our products and technology,"" the head of GM in China, Julian Blissett, told Reuters.

While he declined to name which cars would be sold through Durant Guild, he said think of U.S. premium models currently unavailable in China such as the all-electric GMC Hummer pick-up or sports-utility vehicle (SUV), the hulking gasoline-fuelled Chevrolet Tahoe SUV or the sleek Chevrolet Corvette sports car.

Blissett, a 16-year veteran of the Chinese market, said such ""halo cars"" would fit nicely into communities of consumers in cities who have started to harbour an interest in performance cars for racing, or SUVs to venture off the beaten track.

""There's a lot more appetite to take more off-road types of vehicles to explore nature, and that wasn't a trend five, 10 years ago,"" Blissett said in an interview.

Durant Guild, which is named after GM's founder William Durant, will be wholly owned and operated by GM and will launch officially as soon as this month.

To mark the launch, GM is hosting a series of invitation-only events, with the first expected in Shanghai on Friday.

SHIFTING FORTUNES

GM hopes that by using a sales and marketing model akin to ones that worked well for Tesla (TSLA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) in China, it will be able to channel any energy and excitement the imports generate back into GM's existing models in the country.

""That will be a positive impact on our business and will support our growth plans in China,"" Blissett said.

GM plans to do this without relying on traditional brick-and-mortar dealerships. It was not immediately clear how GM plans to service cars sold through Durant Guild.

Global automakers such GM, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Toyota (7203.T), which have dominated the combustion age in China, are falling steadily behind local players in a booming electric vehicle (EV) market. read more

Foreign brands including Buick and Chevrolet have dominated in China since the 1990s, typically winning a collective 60% to 70% share of passenger car sales in recent years.

In the first eight months of 2022, however, foreign brands only captured 52.4% of the market.

In a sign of the shifting fortunes, sales by GM's Chinese joint venture with SAIC Motor (SAIC-GM) had fallen 4.6% by the end of August compared with the same period last year, while BYD sales sky-rocketed 267%.

For GM, improving the perception of its brands in China is all the more important as it prepares to unleash a new generation of smart EVs of its own in the country, starting with the Cadillac Lyriq SUV this year.

Felix Weller, head of Durant Guild, said GM had earmarked three new types of consumer it hopes to attract.

First there are the nature lovers interested in glamping, picnicking, trekking and cycling, all while staying close to home in the wake of the pandemic that limited travel options.

Then there are the executive VIPs, successful professionally and busy, while the third group includes young and sporty drivers who are taking performance cars to racing tracks.

A spokesperson said subsequently that there were other communities in China that GM was also interested in wooing through Durant Guild, without giving details.

NO CONFLICT

It was not immediately clear what specific competitive conditions in China's auto marketplace compelled GM to launch a new direct-to-consumer channel to sell specialty vehicles shipped in from North America.

Asked how its Chinese partner has responded to Durant Guild, Blissett said GM had the full support of SAIC (600104.SS) for both the idea and intent behind Durant Guild.

""There is no fundamental tension,"" he said.

The GM China chief also said there had been no push back from Chinese dealers marketing Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet cars for GM and SAIC, partly because there was no crossover.

""It's a business they don't have to date, so we're not cutting anything from anybody. It's an incremental, additional business,"" Blissett said.

Asked about Durant Guild, a spokesperson for SAIC said: ""The new platform is complementary to SAIC-GM's existing business. It doesn't conflict with anything we do.""

Weller said Durant Guild will try to go beyond placing its experience centers inside shopping malls, as Tesla and other EV startups have done, but that strategy was still being finalised.

He said GM had no plans to use a similar direct-to-consumer model for Buick, Chevy and Cadillac cars already on sale in China - or to take the Durant Guild model beyond China.

Chee-Kiang Lim, managing director for China at Detroit-based automotive consultancy Urban Science, said a direct sales model such as Durant Guild was a cost-effective way to market cars and maximise profits - and GM's focus on changing lifestyles among consumers could be a differentiator.

But he said GM should not overlook an even more critical consumer trend, where consumers are increasingly preoccupied with smart, connected features.

""What Chinese consumers want is to extend their digital lifestyles to their cars. Cars from foreign brands designed and engineered overseas are increasingly not meeting these needs,"" Lim said.

""If Durant can overcome this bias and provide high-tech, personalised features and seamless connectivity to China's digital ecosystems, its odds of success in the China marketplace will be higher.""

SEOUL, Aug 29 (Reuters) - South Korean officials will meet U.S. counterparts this week to express ""concerns"" about the Inflation Reduction Act, which restricts who can receive U.S. subsidies for the production of electric vehicles and where firms can source battery materials.

President Joe Biden signed into law this month a $430 billion bill, seen as the biggest climate package in U.S. history. read more

The law requires that EVs be assembled in North America to qualify for tax credits, ending subsidies for several EV models, and that a percentage of critical minerals used in batteries come from the United States or an American free-trade partner. read more

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Automakers like Hyundai Motor face short-term competitive disadvantage to manufacturers of EVs that receive tax credits in the United States, while industry sources said Korean battery makers must make changes to mineral sourcing routes, which could affect cost adversely.

South Korean officials are expected to tell counterparts from the U.S. Trade Representative's office and the U.S. Treasury that the new law may violate trade norms such as the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement and the WTO agreement, the industry ministry said.

Korean automakers will consider adjusting production plans to prioritise the construction of U.S. plants for example, the ministry said, while battery makers will seek to diversify where they source minerals from.

Under new rules to kick in next year, at least 40% of the monetary value of the critical minerals in batteries will need to come from the United States or an American free-trade partner, with that proportion rising to 80% by 2027. read more

Globally, the treatment of some 58% of lithium, 64% of cobalt and 70% of graphite goes through China, according to ministry data.

FALLOUT

The new rules are a major complication for battery makers LG Energy Solution (LGES) (373220.KS), SK On and Samsung SDI (006400.KS), battery industry sources said.

South Korea's LGES supplies Tesla (TSLA.O) and General Motors (GM.N), while SK On and Samsung SDI supply Ford Motor (F.N) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) among others. The three battery makers together command more than a quarter of the global EV battery market, according to SNE Research.

""It's become a huge headache.... Automaker clients said they didn't expect this new law would take effect this soon,"" said a South Korean battery industry source.

A second South Korean battery industry source said the government needed to ask for the United States to delay the battery sourcing rule as it was going to take a long time to verify where all the components and minerals came from, let alone make any changes to sourcing.

""We don't have many options other than asking the United States to alleviate the battery component and mineral rules and to delay the actual implementation,"" said the second source.

The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

LGES, SK On and Samsung SDI declined to comment on whether they expect to meet the requirements by next year.

For automakers, analysts said the changes to EV subsidies would have a limited financial impact because Hyundai (005380.KS) and Kia's (000270.KS) U.S. EV sales make up a small percentage of their overall U.S. car sales.

Still it represented a set-back, they said.

""Hyundai is at a disadvantage in the short-term compared to automakers whose EVs receive credits, as electrification of the U.S. auto market accelerates,"" said Meritz Securities analyst Kim Jun-sung.

A Hyundai Motor spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.

HONG KONG, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology has shelved a plan to raise $1.5 billion through an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong because of lukewarm investor interest, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

Bankers and advisers had hoped a deal of the size planned by Leapmotor, which would have been Hong Kong's largest IPO so far in 2022, would revive the city's flagging new issue market.

Instead, the deal has been put on hold and Leapmotor is considering cutting the size of the transaction, one of the sources said.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The decision to pause the Hong Kong IPO was made after the company met with investors over the past week to gauge sentiment towards the company and its listing plans, the sources said.

A smaller IPO size would be more attractive to cautious investors and the deal could be brought back if market conditions improve, the first source said.

Leapmotor did not respond to an emailed request for comment.

The sources could not be named as the information was not yet public.

Leapmotor produces four electric vehicle models that mainly target China's middle- and lower-end mass market in a 79,500 yuan-300,000 yuan ($11,466.40-$43,269.44) price range, according to its website and prospectus filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Bigger EV makers such as Nio Inc (9866.HK) see themselves more as China's challenger to Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), mainly producing more expensive and high-end cars.

Leapmotor was ranked 12th in terms of sales in the first seven months among all EV makers in China, with a market share of 2.3%, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.

It was founded in 2015 in Hangzhou, capital of China's Southeastern Zhejiang province, by the country's second-largest surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology (002236.SZ) and its founders.

The firm also counts investment major Sequoia Capital China and state-owned Shanghai Electric Group Corp among its main backers.

Leapmotor had planned to use the proceeds of the IPO for research and development as well as to boost its production capacity and sales network.

It was not immediately clear what impact the IPO's shelving will have on its operations and growth plans.

Volatile financial market conditions caused by Chinese economic growth concerns, the Russia-Ukraine war, high inflation and tightening monetary conditions in major economies have hit investor sentiment in 2022.

Hong Kong IPO volumes have crashed nearly 90% year to date to the lowest level in nine years.

There has been just $2.36 billion raised so far this year, not including secondary listings of Tianqi Lithium (002466.SZ), China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp (601888.SS) and others, compared with $22.2 billion in the same period of 2021, according to Refinitiv data.

NASA and Russian space agency Roscosmos signed an agreement in July allowing Russian cosmonauts to fly on U.S.-made spacecraft in exchange for American astronauts being able to ride on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. read more

Russia's RIA news agency reported at the time that the agreement envisaged six flights in total between 2022 and 2024, with each country getting three flights each on the other's spacecraft.

""The agreement has now been signed for the first three flights,"" said Sergei Krikalev, executive director of Roscosmos

""If the implementation of this agreement will be positive then we will certainly continue it.""

The deal is an unusual example of Moscow and Washington still cooperating at a time when ties are at a post-Cold War low due to tensions over what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, a conflict the West calls an unprovoked war of aggression.

Russia has cast doubt over space cooperation in other areas and spoken of pulling out of the International Space Station after 2024 to develop its own orbital station. It has so far sent mixed messages however, suggesting that date could significantly slip.

The flight sharing agreement signed in July will see Russian cosmonaut Anna Kikina fly on a Crew Dragon spacecraft developed by U.S. aerospace manufacturer SpaceX in the autumn.

Kikina, who will be the first cosmonaut to fly on a Crew Dragon ship, told reporters on Friday she was initially shocked to learn she would not fly on Soyuz, Russia's flagship spacecraft that has been used since the 1960s.

""Well considering the fact that all my professional life I was preparing to fly on Soyuz, I was preparing for it, in principle, and was focusing on it... suddenly the thought settled in my head that - no - I'm not flying a Soyuz, how can that be?"" Kikina said.

""But then I had a rethink. Yes I realised that I might be going on another ship, but with the knowledge that I would definitely go on Soyuz too.""

She said she would be observing the U.S. tradition of driving to the launch pad in a Tesla (TSLA.O) produced by the carmaker headed by billionaire Elon Musk, who also founded SpaceX.

""Of course I will observe crew traditions, because I am part of this crew,"" she said.

Space exploration was one of the few areas where the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated during the Cold War, culminating in a symbolic ""space handshake"" between a cosmonaut and an astronaut during the Apollo–Soyuz mission in 1975.

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Thursday, lifted by gains in Nvidia and other technology-related stocks as investors focused on the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference for clues about the central bank's policy outlook.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to give a speech on Friday that investors will dissect for indications of how aggressively the Fed may move to raise interest rates as it battles decades-high inflation.

""We're in a period of time between the end of the second-quarter earnings season and meaningful additional data from the Federal Reserve. Markets are churning a bit with a reasonably low level of volatility,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

The yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury note faded after recently hitting a two-month high. Declining interest rates tend to benefit technology stocks trading at high valuations.

""Lower interest rates have certainly put some support underneath some of the more growth-oriented sectors,"" Northey said.

Nvidia (NVDA.O) jumped 4% after the graphics chipmaker gave a weaker-than-expected quarterly forecast that many investors viewed as signaling the worst of a sales downturn may be over. That drove a rally in the Philadelphia semiconductor index (.SOX). read more

Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft rose more than 1%, while Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) added more than 2%, with all four companies making substantial contributions to the Nasdaq's increase.

Summary Companies Deal would not include Renault partner Nissan - sources

Oil company role could help green hydrogen development -source

PARIS, Aug 31 (Reuters) - China's Geely Automobile Holdings (0175.HK) and an oil group are in talks about taking stakes in the fossil-fuel engine unit Renault (RENA.PA) plans to separate from its electric vehicle (EV) business, two sources close to the French carmaker said.

But Renault's alliance partner, Japanese carmaker Nissan (7201.T), does not plan to take a stake in the combustion engine unit, the sources told Reuters.

Renault and Geely declined to comment. Nissan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The French carmaker is due to unveil this autumn plans for creating an EV-dedicated unit based in France and another one based abroad that will bring together all of its petrol and hybrid engine and transmissions production sites in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Romania and Latin America.

Renault intends to remain the majority shareholder in its ""Ampère"" electrical division, which will employ around 10,000 people and could list on the stock market in the second half of 2023.

But it will only retain a minority stake in its ""Horse"" combustion engine business, which will have a similar sized workforce, but would remain a reference shareholder with significant clout in the unit.

The two sources said Renault would hold a 40% stake in the fossil-fuel engine unit, while Geely would also hold 40% and an oil company the remaining 20%.

But the plan is not finalized ""and other tracks exist for partner manufacturers"", one of the sources said.

That would not include Nissan, despite a proposal from Renault that it participate in the deal, the two sources added, a further indication that the strategy of the alliance partners continues to diverge.

The alliance's long-term future has been uncertain since the fall of former boss Carlos Ghosn in 2018. Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi (7211.T) say more than 80% of their models will be based on common architectures in 2026, but questions remain about plans for the 2030s.

SHARING COSTS

A deal with Geely would add to the Chinese carmaker's burgeoning business. Geely owns Sweden's Volvo Cars (VOLCARb.ST), British sports car maker Lotus and holds a stake in Mercedes (MBGn.DE).

By sharing costs for diesel and gasoline engines that are set to decline as EV sales rise, Renault hopes to free up funds to reinvest in electric models, a technology it pioneered with Nissan and Mitsubishi, but where it has fallen behind the likes of Tesla (TSLA.O).

The participation of an oil company would also help the development of green hydrogen and the infrastructure required to make hydrogen fuel cell cars viable alongside battery EVs, one of the sources added. Hydrogen is categories 'green' when it is made with renewable power and is seen as key to help decarbonise industry.

As part of a drastic restructuring to boost its finances, Renault has recently cemented new partnerships alongside its historical alliances with Nissan, Mitsubishi and Mercedes.

In May the French carmaker sold 34% of its South Korean subsidiary to Geely. Renault will also develop hybrid vehicles produced at its plant in Busan with Geely.

STAVANGER, Norway/FRANKFURT, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of economic terrorism on Monday as the cost of Europe's energy crisis spiralled with Germany on the hook for at least 19 billion euros to bail out its biggest importer of Russian gas.

A surge in gas prices as top exporter Russia cuts supplies has squeezed German utility company Uniper (UN01.DE), prompting it to seek an extra 4 billion euros ($4 billion) in credit lines from Berlin, on top of a 15 billion euro bailout deal agreed last month. read more

The Czech Republic, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, called an emergency meeting of energy ministers for Sept. 9 when it will propose a cap on the price of gas used for electricity production. read more

""What is going on is really a pan-European problem, it has an impact on all countries, on some less and on some more. And that is why we are convinced the best solution is a Europe-wide solution,"" Czech Industry Minister Jozef Sikela told a news conference.

German benchmark power prices for 2023 breached 1,000 euros per megawatt hour for the first time on Monday as supply concerns kept prices of gas and related fuels such as electricity and coal sky-high.

""Russia is using economic terror,"" Zelenskiy told an energy industry conference in the Norwegian city of Stavanger.

""It is exerting pressure with price crisis, with poverty, to weaken Europe,"" Zelenskiy told the audience via a translator.

His comments come as Russia's Gazprom plans maintenance this week that will halt gas flows along the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that links Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea.

The outage has fuelled fears that Russia is curbing supply to put pressure on Western nations opposed to its invasion of Ukraine, a charge Moscow denies.

""NO LEHMAN BROTHERS RERUN""

Countries such as Germany and Italy, heavily reliant on Russian gas imports for their energy, have been building up storage levels ahead of the cold winter months when demand peaks.

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said that German gas storage facilities were more than 80% full and he expects prices to retreat. Italy has hit a similar level, giving a cushion against further supply shocks. read more

Germany would get through the winter better than some people thought a short time ago, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Monday.

Habeck also stressed that Germany will not allow a Lehman Brothers-style domino-effect to happen on its gas market.

""I promise on behalf of the German government that we will always ensure liquidity for all energy companies, that we don't have a Lehman Brothers effect on the market,"" said Habeck, referring to the U.S. investment bank's collapse, which helped trigger the 2008 financial crisis.

There was a less upbeat prediction from the head of gas major Shell who warned the gas shortages could persist.

""It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions,"" Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told a news conference at the industry meeting in Stavanger. read more

MILAN, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Ferrari (RACE.MI) unveiled on Tuesday its first SUV, the 390,000 euro ($397,000), 12-cylinder Purosangue, aimed at super-rich drivers still not ready to go all-electric.

While late to the SUV market, the Italian brand famed for its prancing horse logo is sure the luxury sports car-style of the Purosangue - or Thoroughbred - will make the model stand out.

""Since we announced it was a V12 (in May), the interest for the car exploded,"" Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer Enrico Galliera told reporters at Ferrari headquarters in Maranello, adding the company had been inundated with pre-orders from customers who have not even seen it. He did not give numbers.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Despite its size and weight, Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna prefers to describe the four-door, four-seat Purosangue, which has a top speed of over 310 kph (190 mph), as a versatile sports car, rather than an SUV.

It illustrates a dilemma facing many established automakers. Investors have made electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O) the industry's most valuable company, and policymakers around the world are setting deadlines to stop selling combustion vehicles.

But a large group of consumers still want petrol-burning vehicles, and are willing to pay premium prices for them.

Ferrari embraced electrification in its business plan in June, but is taking a slow lane to its goal. read more

Executives declined to give details about possible future plug-in or battery electric versions of the Purosangue.

GAME CHANGER

Over several days, Ferrari is showing the Purosangue to 2,000 of its top-tier clients, but has already received ""many more"" orders, Galliera said.

The car will be one of the most expensive SUVs. Only the Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV is offered at similar price levels.

To preserve exclusivity, Ferrari has pledged to keep Purosangue sales below 20% of total group shipments over the car's life-cycle, which is expected to be four-to-five years, as for its other models.

That means an expected total production of just over 11,000 vehicles, marking a different approach from Lamborghini and Porsche, both part of the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) group, which last year made around 60% of their sales from SUVs.

Deliveries will start in the second quarter of 2023, from Europe, with waiting lists expected to extend over coming years.

It took around four years to develop the Purosangue after Ferrari announced in 2018 it would build an SUV. Before that, the technology was not available to give a car weighing more than two tonnes a top sports performance, Galliera said.

The ""game changer"" was an exclusive, electric-powered active suspension system Ferrari developed with Canadian partner Multimatic Inc, he added.

Other key features include new architecture designed to give the car improved balance, independent four-wheel steering and a 6.5 litre, 725 horsepower engine.

Ferrari, which already has four hybrid cars in its range, has promised 15 new models between next year and 2026, including its first fully-electric car, expected in 2025.

HONG KONG, Sept 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sichuan’s hydropower crisis has some officials calling for accelerated nuclear reactor construction. Unfortunately building plants in arid regions will be tricky. China's path to better atomic energy runs through solar and wind farms.

Sichuan relies on dams for a whopping 80% of its power and exports surplus to other areas, especially industrial centres on the coast. But the relationship is one-way; inadequate transmission lines and immature spot markets prevent other provinces from selling electricity back to Sichuan in a pinch.

This summer's record heatwave, which evaporated reservoirs and pushed up electricity demand as households cranked up air conditioners, exposed the vulnerability of this arrangement. The power crunch, which has started to ease, disrupted the local operations of $26 billion Tianqi Lithium (002466.SZ), Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW), Toyota Motor (7203.T) and others. Officials in Shanghai, home to factories for Tesla (TSLA.O) and other automakers, even lobbied for special access, according to Bloomberg.

Chinese energy officials have vowed to speed up nuclear development, among other things. A much-cited 2018 study by researchers affiliated with the state economic planning agency forecast that for the country to meet its net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050, atomic energy capacity will need to reach 554 gigawatts. That's 28% of the modeled energy mix, versus 21% and 17% for wind and solar respectively.

That would be a boon for companies like CGN Power (003816.SZ) and China National Nuclear Power (601985.SS), but there’s a hitch. There is widespread public opposition to more plants following Japan's 2011 Fukushima accident; authorities have unofficially banned building reactors inland. Last year, the country's 54 coastal reactors generated just 52 GW, or 5% of the total.

Officials are setting their sights on 70 GW by 2025. Anything more ambitious may be a stretch: the 2018 study, for instance, estimated over half of capacity would have to come from installations in the hinterlands. Unfortunately many of these regions are under mounting water stress, and some traditional reactor designs need 1 billion gallons of water per day. Monday’s 6.8 magnitude earthquake in Sichuan, the strongest in nearly a decade, highlights another huge risk.

A more realistic way to boost clean energy without slipping back into fossil fuels is to expand wind and solar capacity now, while pushing harder to roll out safer and less water-intensive nuclear technologies. In December, CNNC launched an experimental ""pebble bed"" reactor that uses gas instead of water; the government recently tested a thorium reactor that uses molten salt for coolant. It’s still early days, but the payoff could be immense.

CONTEXT NEWS

An electricity shortage in China's southwestern province of Sichuan has started to ease, according to state media on Aug. 28. Power for ordinary industrial and commercial users has been restored while that for large industrial users will be gradually restored, except for highly energy-intensive industries.

The National Energy Administration has started to adjust its power development plans for 2021-2025 in response, Reuters reported. The agency said it will accelerate the construction of new hydropower stations as well as the approval of nuclear plants and power transmission projects.

MELBOURNE, Sept 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - If there were more Yvon Chouinards, humans might be doing a better job of battling global warming. Such sentiments are doing the rounds on social media since the founder of Patagonia revealed on Wednesday that he has ceded control of his outdoor clothing firm. His motive: to direct the earnings generated by what will remain a for-profit company into a charity fighting climate and environmental risks that will own virtually all Patagonia’s shares. Yet he could have built a bigger war chest more quickly by selling the company. That he didn’t is an apt riposte to breaking up ESG.

The idea of separating environmental, social and governance concerns from each other has been gaining traction. It has some appeal: around $17 trillion in assets, per the U.S. Sustainable Investment Forum, sit in funds run by managers from BlackRock (BLK.N) to AllianceBernstein that claim to include ESG considerations in their investment decisions. Yet often they aren’t clear about the relative importance of each of the three, creating consternation and confusion. A climate-focused ESG fund probably should own Tesla (TSLA.O), for example, whereas one prioritising social or governance performance would have a tough time justifying the investment.

In practice, all three should form an integral part of a fund manager’s overall analysis. Not only do they interact with one another, excluding or downplaying one type of performance could result in plenty of risks and opportunities being overlooked.

Forcing companies to pick between the three concepts would also create unnecessary dilemmas. Chouinard, for example, wants to steer more money towards protecting the planet. By handing virtually all shares over to a charitable trust, though, he’s limiting his contribution to the firm’s annual earnings of some $100 million a year, per the New York Times. But Patagonia has a strong brand and a roughly 10% profit margin that beats publicly traded apparel companies like Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF.N). So he ought to be able to sell it at a handy premium to the roughly 13 times trailing earnings A&F commands. At, say, a 20 times multiple, he’d have some $2 billion to deploy.

That, though, would risk selling the company to those who might not defend either the company’s environmentally friendly culture or its employees. His unusual solution is one few are likely to replicate. But behind it is a more responsible approach to managing a business than forcing ESG issues into unneeded siloes.

Yvon Chouinard has ceded control of outdoor clothing brand Patagonia, the founder disclosed in a letter on Sept. 14. As a result, all company profit will go to a non-profit entity which will spend it to fight climate change.

As part of the deal, Chouinard and his family have transferred all stock with voting rights to the Patagonia Purpose Trust. Overseen by family members and their advisers, according to the New York Times, the trust will be responsible for approving key decisions like choosing the board of directors.

All non-voting stock, which represents the vast majority of shares, has been given to the Holdfast Collective, which Chouinard calls ""a nonprofit dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature"".

Patagonia has annual revenue in excess of $1 billion and profit of some $100 million, the New York Times reported on Sept. 14.

Aug 26 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's decision to have children with one of his top executives at Neuralink pushed the limits of corporate governance norms, according to nine corporate governance experts who offered divergent interpretations of the startup's code of conduct for employees.

Known more widely for his electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and rocket developer SpaceX, Musk is also the chief executive of Neuralink, a company with about 300 employees that is seeking to develop chips that connect the human brain directly to machines.

He and Shivon Zilis, one of his direct reports at the company, had twin babies last November, Insider reported on July 6, citing a confidential court filing.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Zilis, 36, has since told some of her colleagues that she was not involved romantically with Musk, 51, and conceived the children with him through in vitro fertilization (IVF), according to five people familiar with the situation. Reuters could not establish the accuracy of Zilis’ account.

Zilis and spokespeople for Musk and Neuralink did not respond to requests for comment.

Relationships between supervisors and subordinates are frowned upon at companies and have cost some high-profile CEOs their jobs, as they violate most corporate policies and raise concerns about conflicts of interest, corporate governance experts said.

Neuralink’s 62-page employee handbook, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, prohibits dating, “personal relationships” and “close personal friendships” between employees in a direct supervisory relationship to avoid any conflicts of interest.

But the facts presented by Musk and Zilis’ relationship are so unusual that the corporate governance experts who reviewed the policy for Reuters expressed divergent views on whether they thought the entrepreneur had violated it by having children with his subordinate through IVF.

“Whatever lawyer wrote this language did not contemplate this situation,” said Nell Minow, vice chair of corporate governance consultancy ValueEdge Advisors, referring to the Neuralink code of conduct.

She added that the situation appeared to “fall between the cracks” of the policy’s intent to avoid conflicts of interest due to relationships between employees.

Neuralink’s code of conduct calls for relationships that can create a conflict of interest to be disclosed to the company’s “people operations manager” so that the company can decide whether it should take steps to eliminate any conflict.

Reuters could not learn whether Musk or Zilis had disclosed the relationship to Kristy Hilands, the people operations manager. Hilands did not respond to requests for comment.

Neuralink has accepted Zilis’ description of a non-romantic relationship, and she continues in her role as director of operations and special projects, a source familiar with the company’s handling of the matter said. In the weeks since the disclosure of their having children, Musk and Zilis have also continued working together, taking the helm at internal and external company meetings, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.

For example, after learning in recent weeks that competitor Synchron had beaten Neuralink to a human trial in the United States, Musk sent Zilis to approach the company’s CEO Thomas Oxley and arrange a meeting, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Zilis and Musk spoke with Oxley shortly after about a possible investment by Musk in Synchron, the sources said.

OPEN TO INTERPRETATION

Four of the corporate governance experts said they believed Zilis having children with Musk through IVF should be read as having a “personal relationship” or “close friendship” under Neuralink’s code of conduct. The code defines a personal relationship as one where the individuals have a “continuing relationship of a romantic or intimate nature and who are not married to each other.” It does not define a close friendship.

“You’re layering intimate familial bonds over professional relationships,” said Gabriel Rauterberg, a corporate law professor at the University of Michigan. “There is always the worry that someone with greater power will use their professional power in ways that are inappropriate.”

The other five corporate governance experts interviewed by Reuters either did not think Musk and Zilis’ arrangement was a breach under the Neuralink policy or could not come to a definitive conclusion.

Usha Rodrigues, a professor at the University of Georgia’s law school, said Musk and Zilis’ situation “may fall under ‘close friendship’ if there is an ongoing, co-parenting type relationship, but that is subject to interpretation.”

The extent of Musk’s involvement in the life of his children with Zilis could not be learned by Reuters. The court filing published by Insider shows that in April, they asked for the children to take Musk’s last name. Musk and Zilis also listed the same address in Texas.

Joan Heminway, a business professor at the University of Tennessee’s law school, said one cannot easily prove that Musk and Zilis are close personally, even if they had IVF together. “That’s the new wrench here,” she said.

SINGAPORE/BEIJING, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Even as China bars 1.4 billion citizens from Twitter, its local authorities are splurging on global advertising on the site, helping make the country the platform's fastest-growing overseas ad market and one of its largest non-U.S. revenue sources.

A Reuters review of publicly available government tenders, budget documents and promoted tweets from 2020 to 2022 shows local government authorities and Chinese Communist Party propaganda offices for cities, provinces and even districts across the country have flocked to Twitter (TWTR.N) to buy ads.

The promotions, often outsourced by local governments to state media, pitched local attractions, as well as cultural and economic achievements, to an international audience, and were permitted under an exemption to Twitter's ban on state-media advertising.

The review shows for the first time just how important China has become for Twitter, under pressure from investors to meet growth targets as its U.S. business stalls. It comes with the company embroiled in a legal battle with Tesla (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk, who is attempting to back out of his unsolicited $44 billion offer to buy Twitter. read more

Four sources told Reuters operations in China became a source of internal clashes between teams keen to maximise the sales opportunity and others concerned at the optics of doing business with state-affiliated entities at a time of growing tension between Beijing and Washington.

Twitter's dealings in China came to the fore on Tuesday when the U.S. Senate Judiciary committee held a hearing to consider a whistleblower complaint filed by Twitter's former security chief Peiter ""Mudge"" Zatko. read more

He referenced this Reuters story when testifying about how the FBI told Twitter there was a Chinese agent working at the company.

Among other claims, his 84-page complaint alleged ""Twitter executives knew that accepting Chinese money risked endangering users in China,"" and that ""Mr Zatko was told that Twitter was too dependent upon the revenue stream at this point to do anything other than attempt to increase it."" Reuters could not independently verify the claims.

Twitter denies the accusations. Zatko, through an attorney, earlier declined to comment.

During the hearing, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said that Zatko's disclosures to the committee alleged that the FBI notified Twitter of at least one Chinese agent in the company.

Zatko said during the hearing the agent was alleged to be from China's Ministry of State Security, the country's main espionage agency.

The former executive told the hearing that Twitter employees had been ""disturbed"" that, despite being banned in China, the platform was accepting money from organizations associated with the Chinese government, resulting in an ""internal conundrum"".

""The response was we’re already in bed. It would be problematic if we lost that revenue stream so figure out a way to make people comfortable with it,” Zatko told senators.

Two people with knowledge of the matter said Twitter's China sales team actively courted local governments in the country as part of its global strategy to compete for ad business with tech rivals like Alphabet's Google and Meta's (META.O) Facebook.

Gaming, e-commerce, and tech firms in China are also key Twitter customers, according to two sources. Twitter's sales of overseas ads to Chinese clients are estimated to be in the ""hundreds of millions of dollars a year"", the people said, the majority coming from these companies.

The people with knowledge of the matter declined to be identified citing confidentiality agreements.

Twitter declined to comment on internal discussions and its sales performance in China. A spokesperson said the company has never hidden the fact that it does business with Chinese commercial entities.

'INFORMATION IMBALANCE'

The company banned political and state-media advertising in 2019, though an August blog announcement that year allowed a carveout for ads ""from (state-media) accounts solely dedicated to entertainment, sports and travel content"". In March this year, though, that exemption was rescinded, effectively banning state-media firms from advertising on Twitter altogether.

In a March Twitter blog post, the company's vice-president of global public policy, Sinead McSweeney, said that ""a severe information imbalance"" is created when governments that block access to Twitter within their state continue to use it for their own communications.

Still, Reuters found dozens of ads for Chinese local governments, as well as for state media themselves, published on Twitter since March. Twitter, like other platforms, also derives revenue when advertisers submit ads via a self-service online platform.

Twitter said it is improving auto-detection technology aimed at activities that violate the platform's policies. ""This work is challenging and we know we have more to do,"" the company said in a statement.

The Chinese Communist Party's top propaganda organ and the central government's ministry of culture and tourism, both based in Beijing, did not respond to a request for comment.

'LIFE IS BRILLIANT'

Twitter's China region has seen an 800-fold improvement in revenue since 2014, the fastest-growing globally, according to the now-deleted LinkedIn bio of Twitter Greater China Managing Director Alan Lan. The bio was reviewed by Reuters late in August before it was taken down.

Twitter declined to comment on the number in the bio nor make Lan, who leads the Singapore-based China sales team, available for comment.

Chinese local authorities continued buying foreign social media ads and content even after the COVID-19 pandemic triggered the closure of the country's borders, according to a review of 36 publicly available local government tenders, budget documents from 2020-2022, and social media accounts. It wasn't immediately clear why such ads were placed with China effectively closed.

""Life is always unusually brilliant because we are in Wuhan,"" one promoted tweet from the @Visit_Wuhan account in July 2021 read, part of a 2 million yuan ($289,000) government tender.

Another promoted tweet from September 2022, a verified account for the province of Shaanxi, famous for its Terracotta Warriors, urged users to ""Hurry up and follow me to Shaanxi to feel its charm!""

AD POLICY TESTED

Some Washington-based senior Twitter executives, worried the expansion of its China business could backfire on the company, pushed for sales to Chinese government-affiliated accounts to be curbed altogether during the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump as tensions with Beijing worsened in 2020, according to two sources.

Twitter declined to comment on internal discussions.

An attempt to set up what would have been the company's first mainland China-based sales office was shut down in 2019 on data security concerns, sources said, as tensions swirled internally over the company's operations in China.

Twitter didn't respond to questions on the mainland office talks.

Reuters' review of more than 300 accounts representing local governments found that as of the time of this story's publication less than a dozen were labelled by Twitter as state-affiliated media. Publicly available tender documents reviewed by Reuters show the vast majority of these accounts are outsourced to state media.

@iChongqing_CIMC, a state-run operation paid by the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, as well as the verified accounts @PDChinaLife and @PDChinaSports, run by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, all continued to advertise on Twitter until as recently as last month.

As the business grew, Chinese local government accounts ramped up their demands on the company, asking for blue-tick verifications just as accounts elsewhere do, or for help with negative activity targeting their accounts, two sources said.

""Some of the government accounts would earlier complain to their Twitter sales reps when there's negative stuff or bots,"" said one person familiar with China's Twitter sales operations, adding that Twitter only acted on complaints about spam accounts commenting on or engaging with Chinese local government accounts.

The buying of ads on Twitter by state-affiliated entities has come as Chinese police have increased arrests of citizens who have found ways to use the platform to criticise authorities, according to Chinese news coverage of court cases.

Chinese courts have sentenced dozens of people in the past three years for using Twitter and other foreign platforms to criticise authorities, according to court records and media articles.

China rarely comments on such cases, but when it does it justifies the punishment by accusing the critics of trying to subvert the regime.

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has demanded a safety advocacy group take down videos of its vehicles running over child dummies when its driver assistant system was engaged, calling them ""defamatory"" and ""misleading.""

The group, the Dawn Project, has launched a nationwide TV campaign warning of alleged potential dangers of what Tesla calls ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) software, adding to public and regulatory scrutiny of the technology.

One of the videos posted by the group shows a Tesla vehicle with FSD software running over child-sized mannequins, and says ""Tell Congress to Shut it Down.""

In a Cease and Desist letter dated Aug. 11, Tesla said the Dawn Project and its founder ""have been disparaging Tesla's commercial interests and disseminating defamatory information to the public."" The letter was disclosed by the Dawn Project on Thursday.

Tesla threatened to take legal action, saying the tests in the videos are ""likely fraudulent"" and ""misrepresent the capabilities of Tesla’s technology.""

The U.S. safety regulator has stepped up investigations of Tesla's Autopilot system following a series of crashes.

The company said its ""FSD Beta,"" a test version of its new automated driving technology used by a limited number of consumers, ""does recognize pedestrians, including children, and when utilized properly, the system reacts to prevent or mitigate a collision.""

The Dawn Project was founded by Dan O'Dowd, a critic of Tesla's FSD system and a software entrepreneur in California who had run for the U.S. Senate.

The Dawn Project said its tests are ""are completely legitimate and not deceptive,"" and called Tesla's letter ""marketing propaganda.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Aug 29 (Reuters) - The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) said on Monday it was unlawful for Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) to prohibit employees from wearing shirts bearing union insignia, ruling in a 2017 dispute between the electric car maker and the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union.

NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran said the decision reaffirms ""any attempt to restrict the wearing of union clothing or insignia is presumptively unlawful and – consistent with Supreme Court precedent – an employer has a heightened burden to justify attempts to limit this important right.""

In a 3-2 decision, the NLRB said that when companies interfere with employees' rights to display union insignia the employer ""has the burden to establish special circumstances"" and the majority ""found that Tesla failed to establish special circumstances in this case.""

Tesla and the UAW did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In addition to ruling on the Tesla case, the NLRB also reversed a 2019 decision by the agency involving Walmart Inc (WMT.N), saying the earlier decision ""ignored decades of board precedent.""

The previous ruling by the NLRB had said Walmart's justification for restricting union insignia on the selling floor to enhance the customer shopping experience and prevent theft or vandalism was legitimate. The NLRB in 2019 did, however, acknowledge the potential interference with employees’ rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

The 2019 decision set a precedent for employers across the country to have more control over limiting union apparel.

Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The NLRB said some Tesla employees assembling electric vehicles at its Fremont, California, plant wore shirts with union logos during a 2017 UAW union organizing campaign. At that time, the UAW was seeking to represent workers at Tesla’s facility in Fremont, who are not unionized.

Tesla's ""team-wear"" policy required employees to wear black shirts imprinted with the Tesla logo or their own black T-shirts without logo. The NLRB found that this implicitly prohibited employees from substituting any shirt with a logo or emblem, including a shirt bearing union insignia.

The NLRB said that before 2017 Tesla production employees regularly wore shirts that were not black or had logos and emblems unrelated to Tesla. On Monday, it ordered Tesla to rescind its policy prohibiting employees from wearing black union shirts.

This is not the first clash between Tesla and the NLRB.

In 2021, the NLRB said that a 2018 tweet by CEO Elon Musk, in which he threatened that Tesla employees who formed a union would lose their stock options, was illegal and should be deleted.

Aug 26 (Reuters) - Panasonic Holdings Corp (6752.T), a supplier to electric-car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), is in talks to build an additional electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in the United States at a cost of around $4 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Panasonic is looking at Oklahoma as the location for its new plant, the newspaper said. (https://on.wsj.com/3pJJs1F)

A Panasonic spokesperson said: ""We are examining various growth strategies for our automotive battery business, but there is no further information that we can share at the moment aside from what we have already announced.""

In July, Panasonic selected Kansas as the site for a new battery plant that state officials said would create up to 4,000 jobs with investment of up to $4 billion. read more

At that time, the Oklahoma Department of Commerce said it and its partners ""continue(d) to work with Project Ocean,"" Panasonic's battery factory project, and were ""optimistic for additional opportunities with them in the future"".

The department said on Friday that ""due to non-discourse agreements (on projects), we will not be providing comments on this story"".

Earlier this year, Oklahoma said it would allocate $698 million to pursue Project Ocean under a bill aimed at attracting an unidentified company that will invest a minimum of $3.6 billion and create at least 4,000 new jobs within five years.

Oklahoma is a neighbouring state to Texas, home to Tesla's car and battery production facilities.

The Japanese conglomerate also said it was looking at potential factory sites in Kansas and Oklahoma to supply the batteries to Tesla's plant in Texas. read more

Panasonic has partnered with Tesla for more than a decade, supplying batteries from its factory in Nevada, California.

The auto industry has been ramping up production of EVs to meet a surge in demand, driving up orders for batteries and raw materials such as lithium and cobalt, among others.

Sept 20 (Reuters) - A fire outbreak at PG&E Corp's (PCG.N) energy storage facility that uses battery packs made by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has been fully controlled, the Monterey County sheriff's office in California said late on Tuesday night.

The shelter-in-place advisory and all road closures have also been lifted, the county sheriff's office and the North County Fire Department said.

The incident, which caused a part of the Highway 1 in California to shut down, came about a year after another fire broke out in a Tesla's ""Megapack"" battery unit in Australia during testing of one of the world's biggest energy storage projects. read more

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The California facility is one of the biggest utility-owned, lithium-ion battery energy storage systems in the world, and power producer PG&E said the incident has caused no electrical outage for customers.

The electric utilities company said upon detecting the issue the safety systems automatically disconnected the battery storage facility from the electrical grid and that no onsite personnel was injured due to the fire. The company said it became aware of the fire at around 01:30 a.m. on Sept. 20.

Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Tesla generates most of its revenue from its electric car business, but Chief Executive Elon Musk has pledged to grow its solar energy and battery storage business to roughly the same size as its car business for the long-term.

The company last year broke ground on its factory in Lathrop, California, to produce its large-scale, utility storage battery unit Megapack.

PG&E in April announced the commissioning of its 182.5-megawatt (MW) Tesla Megapack battery energy storage system (BESS) – known as the Elkhorn Battery – located at its Moss Landing electric substation in Monterey County.

PG&E said batteries are charged when energy demand is low or when solar production is high and then provide additional capacity by sending that reserved power to the grid as demand grows.

It was not immediately known who is the battery cell supplier for Tesla's battery products.

Earlier, Musk said the world must continue to extract oil and gas in order to sustain civilisation, while also developing sustainable sources of energy.

""Realistically I think we need to use oil and gas in the short term, because otherwise civilisation will crumble,"" Musk told reporters on the sidelines of the conference.

""One of the biggest challenges the world has ever faced is the transition to sustainable energy and to a sustainable economy,"" he said. ""That will take some decades to complete.""

He said offshore wind power generation in the North Sea, combined with stationary battery packs, could become a key source of energy. ""It could provide a strong, sustainable energy source in winter,"" he said.

DETROIT, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co(F.N) Chief Executive Jim Farley will go to Las Vegas next week to roll the dice on a strategy to convince dealers to cut as much as $2,000 from the cost of delivering an electric vehicle to a customer.

Ford has told dealers that one key topic for the meetings will be a discussion of new agreements that would govern how dealers sell Ford's expanding lineup of electric vehicles.

Farley told analysts in July that Ford needs to cut $2,000 a vehicle out of selling and distribution costs to be competitive with Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and other electric vehicle startups that sell directly to consumers without franchised dealers.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

About a third of those savings could come from what Farley called a ""low inventory model,"" where customers order a vehicle and Ford ships it to the customer, rather than stocking vehicles on dealer lots for weeks or months.

""We think that's about -- worth maybe $600, $700 in our system,"" Farley told analysts. Tesla can also adjust prices rapidly on its website, and keep most of the gain from a price increase.

Ford declined to comment other than to say “we are excited to meet next week with our North America dealers to grow and win together.”

Dealers said they expect Ford to outline minimum investments for charging stations and other equipment to support electric vehicle customers.

A key question will be how quickly dealers will be required to install chargers, which dealers said can cost as much as $500,000.

""The manufacturers so far have let us scale into it and I think Ford will hopefully do the same thing. You just can't say, 'Listen, we're going to sell 2 million electric cars five years from now and we expect you to put in five superchargers,'"" said Rhett Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford, a large dealership in Columbus, Ohio.

Tesla's success at selling electric vehicles without franchised dealers is putting pressure on all established automakers to overhaul their retail networks.

A shift by Ford to a Tesla-style build to order system could come with caps on the profit margins dealers can earn on a new vehicle sale, some dealers said.

""I see dealer margins still being very competitive, but they are going to shift,"" Farley said in July. Ford intends to put more emphasis on selling products and services after the initial vehicle sale, he said.

Dealers said state franchise laws could give dealers leverage to resist efforts by Ford to set fixed prices or fixed fees for delivering electric vehicles.

Rival General Motors Co (GM.N) last week said it would offer buyouts to U.S. Buick dealers who did not want to make required investments as the brand shifted to an all-electric lineup. GM has already spent $274 million to reduce the ranks of U.S. Cadillac dealers. read more

Josh Sloan, the general manager who oversees two Ford stores and one Lincoln store for Michigan's LaFontaine Automotive Group, said his company is prepared to spend what it takes to shift to electric vehicles.

""I was surprised there weren't higher standards from Ford sooner,"" Sloan said. ""We're moving into this really fast. If you're not all-in, you're going to lose.""

Battery makers are looking to increase production in the U.S. where a shift toward electric vehicles (EV) could increase as the country implements stricter regulation and tightens tax credit eligibility.

The location of the plant has not been finalised, the companies said, but two people briefed on the matter confirmed reports Honda is seriously considering Ohio, where Honda's main U.S. factory is located.

The companies aim for annual production capacity of approximately 40 GWh with the batteries supplied exclusively to Honda facilities in North America to power Honda and Acura EV models.

The pair are expected to establish a joint venture before building the plant, with the start of construction planned for early 2023 and mass-production by the end of 2025.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said his administration is working with Honda and LG ""to ensure that they choose Ohio for this new electric battery plant."" The sources briefed on the matter said an announcement on the location could come in weeks.

The U.S. government has been pushing policies designed to bring more battery and EV manufacturing into the country.

President Joe Biden signed a $430 billion climate, health care and tax bill this month that would render electric vehicles assembled outside North America ineligible for tax credits. read more

The two companies said a combination of strong local electric vehicle production and the timely supply of batteries would put them ""in the best position to target the rapidly-growing North American EV market.""

LG Energy Solution, which is mainly engaged in the development of lithium-ion battery materials and next-generation batteries, also supplies EV batteries and has signed joint-venture agreements with General Motors (GM.N), Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and Stellantis (STLA.MI). read more

SEOUL/DETROIT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - After grabbing the No. 2 spot in the U.S. electric vehicle market with stylish, long-range models, Hyundai Motor and Kia are the automakers with the most to lose from new rules that halt subsidies for EVs made outside North America.

These two companies, which make the popular Ioniq 5 and EV6 models, sold more than 39,000 EVs in the United States between January and July – doubling last year's sales and blowing past Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and General Motors Co (GM.N).

But the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden last month excludes Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and its affiliate Kia Corp (000270.KS) from federal tax credits because they don't yet make EVs in North America, knocking their EV ambitions in the short term at least, a Hyundai official, parts suppliers, analysts and car dealers said.

Only about 20 EVs qualify for subsidies under the new rules, among them models from Ford and BMW (BMWG.DE), and starting next year, GM and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O). The rules also specify requirements for EV battery materials and parts sourcing from 2023. read more

Other foreign carmakers such as Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) which will also be affected by the law have less at stake because they offer fewer models or command less market share.

""If all things are equal and if I buy this one I get a $7,500 tax credit and if I buy that one I don't, I love you Hyundai but I'm going to go with the one where I can get a tax credit,"" said Andrew DiFeo, a Florida-based dealer who has seen a few potential customers already drop Hyundai EVs as a preference.

Hyundai Motor Group, which announced over $10 billion in U.S. investments some three months back including a $5.5 billion EV plant in Georgia, is not pleased. read more

Biden had thanked Hyundai for the investments in May: ""Thank you again for choosing the United States. We will not let you down.""

An official at a large Hyundai supplier who has spoken to senior officials at the company told Reuters that the automaker was caught off guard by the law.

""So much for not letting us down,"" said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""It's a big mess.""

South Korean officials met U.S. counterparts this week to express concerns, and the Financial Times reported that Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Euisun Chung headed to Washington too last week.

A senior government official said on Tuesday Seoul has asked Washington to postpone the new rules until the completion of the Georgia factory in 2025. South Korea has said the new law may violate treaties such as the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement. read more

""Our U.S. EV factory plan was to get subsidies in light of the growing EV market in the United States … the new law negatively and directly affects us,"" said a company official who declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to media.

AMERICAN MADE

While the auto group is considering bringing forward the construction start of the factory to as early as this year, analysts still expect a drop in sales due to a loss of momentum. read more

Analysts said it was too early yet to quantify how much the new rules will cost the companies in revenue and profit, but several said they would likely use incentives to attract American shoppers, a move that could push up costs.

After Biden signed the Act on Aug. 16, shares in Hyundai and Kia fell some 4% each. They have since recovered.

""We are internally considering diverse ways to cope with the Act,"" Hyundai Motor Group said in a statement to Reuters.

While Hyundai and Kia's American EV sales added up to just over a tenth of Tesla's volumes and roughly 9% of the U.S. market share, they suggested that the companies were on their way to cement their position as a top EV player in the country.

Kia has not confirmed plans for a U.S. launch of the EV9, an SUV much bigger than the EV6, though analysts expected it to be a hit with American consumers who prefer big cars. Seoul-based Daol Investment & Securities analyst Yoo Ji-woong said Kia would likely consider making the EV9 in the United States to get subsidies.

Yoo is sanguine that all automakers will ultimately benefit.

""It may take a few years, but eventually the law will help make electric cars more affordable.""

""We had to be cognizant of where the automakers are, where the supply chains are, where the production facilities are,"" California Air Resources Board (CARB) chair Liane Randolph told Reuters in an interview during Climate Week, a summit that takes place alongside the U.N. General Assembly.

""I feel like we landed at the sweet spot.""

In August, CARB said it would require all new vehicles sold in California by 2035 to be electric or plug-in hybrid electrics (PHEVs) after Governor Gavin Newsom issued a 2020 executive order directing the move. CARB said the rules will reduce smog-causing pollution from light-duty vehicles by 25% by 2037 and result in 9.5 million fewer conventional vehicles sold by 2035. Automakers in 2035 can sell no more than 20% of models as PHEVs.

California was not as aggressive as some environmental groups wanted, or Tesla (TSLA.O), which urged ending new gas-powered vehicles by 2030.

""Of course an EV-only automaker is going to want as high a standard as possible because that is going to create a market for their credits,"" Randolph said.

California needs a waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to adopt the 2035 rules, which will open the request for public comment. ""Obviously it's their decision to make but I mean that's why the waiver exists. So California can move forward and protect its residents,"" she said.

President Joe Biden has called for 50% of all new vehicle sales by 2030 to be EVs or plug-in hybrids but not endorsed a phase-out date.

Some states that previously adopted California's zero emission vehicle rules have not yet signed on for the tougher 2035 phase-out date. A spokesman for Colorado's environmental agency told Reuters, ""Colorado is certainly not California and Colorado has our own plan.""

Randolph said ""some states are ready right now"" to adopt 2035 while others will ""get more comfortable as the models continue to roll out.""

She said the regulator has other transportation emissions reductions in the works on medium- and heavy-duty trucks and for in-state locomotives. Randolph added the state is ""working really hard on looking at the Imperial Valley as a potential source of lithium"" for EVs.

The central premise of autonomous vehicles - that computers and artificial intelligence will dramatically reduce accidents caused by human error - has driven much of the research and investment.

But there is a catch: Making robot cars that can drive more safely than people is immensely tough because self-driving software systems simply lack humans' ability to predict and assess risk quickly, especially when encountering unexpected incidents or ""edge cases.""

""Well, my question would be, 'Why?'"" said Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise, a unit of General Motors (GM.N), when asked if he could see a point where remote human overseers should be removed from operations.

""I can provide my customers peace of mind knowing there is always a human there to help if needed,"" Vogt said. ""I don't know why I'd ever want to get rid of that.""

This is the first time Cruise has acknowledged the long-term need for remote human operators.

Like air traffic controllers, such human supervisors could be sitting tens of hundreds of miles away monitoring video feeds from multiple AVs, sometimes with a steering wheel, ready to step in and get stuck robot drivers moving again - AVs invariably stop when they cannot figure out what to do.

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Waymo and Argo, which is backed by Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), declined to comment when asked the same question.

GM recalled and updated software in 80 Cruise self-driving vehicles this month after a June crash in San Francisco left two people injured. U.S. safety regulators said the recalled software could ""incorrectly predict"" an oncoming vehicle's path, and Cruise said the unusual scenario would not recur after the update. read more

For some, the idea that human supervisors could be here to stay raises more doubts about the technology.

Truly autonomous vehicles are far behind the optimistic rollout schedules predicted just a few years ago.

In 2018, GM sought U.S. government approval for a fully autonomous car without a steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals that would enter its commercial ride-sharing fleet in 2019. That vehicle, the Cruise Origin, now is not slated to begin production until spring 2023, Vogt said.

In 2019, Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk promised a million robotaxis ""next year for sure"" - though his company's ""Full Self Driving"" offering has been criticized because its cars are not capable of driving themselves without a human behind the wheel and ready to take manual control in an emergency.

In a June interview on YouTube, Musk said developing self-driving cars was ""way harder than I originally thought, by far."" But when asked for a timeline, he said Tesla could make it ""this year.""

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

The undelivered promise of true autonomy has raised the stakes for the AV industry.

""If these companies don't succeed over the next two years, they're not going to exist anymore,"" said Mike Wagner, CEO of Edge Case Research, which helps AV companies assess, manage and insure risk. ""It's a case of put up or shut up at this point.""

REMOTE HUMANS WATCHING

Many AV startups today use humans as remote supervisors, alongside safety drivers sitting behind the wheel. read more

Those remote humans are an additional expense, but help self-driving cars handle edge cases. These could include something as basic as an unfamiliar set of lane closures during road construction, or erratic, unpredictable behavior by pedestrians or human drivers.

When a robot driver encounters an edge case, ""it puts its hands up and says, 'I don't know what's going on,'"" said Koosha Kaveh, CEO of Imperium Drive, which is using humans as remote operators for cars in the English city of Milton Keynes. Over time, those people will act as ""air traffic controllers,"" supervising a growing number of autonomous cars.

Cruise's Vogt says the company's AVs on the roads in San Francisco currently rely on humans less than 1% of the time. But across hundreds, thousands or even millions of AVs, that would add up to a significant amount of time stopped on the road waiting for human guidance.

Imperium Drive's Kaveh said as more self-driving cars - which are more predictable than humans - hit the roads the number of edge cases will drop, ""but you will never get to zero edge cases.""

""Even decades from now you will not get to 100% truly autonomous vehicles,"" Kaveh added.

Nevertheless, competition is rising. Some Chinese cities are pushing to allow active AV testing more quickly.

The need to tackle edge cases and cut the costs of everything from sensors to the number of humans in the loop in order to get to market has also intensified because investor funding for autonomous cars has plummeted.

Doubt has crept in as investors puzzle over how soon autonomous business will turn profitable. Simpler or slower AVs like trucks or last-mile delivery services operating on highways or on set, low-speed routes are likely to reach profitability first, but will still take years to get there.

Overall investment in future mobility startups has slowed, with AV-focused companies hit especially hard, representing less than 10% of venture investment in the second quarter, according to investor website PitchBook. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3Rzy04y)

Investment in AV startups in the quarter dropped to $958 million. Just two years ago AV investment was booming, as Alphabet's Waymo raised $3 billion, Didi's AV unit raised $500 million and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) acquired AV startup Zoox for $1.3 billion, according to PitchBook.

'RUSH TO MARKET'

Autonomous systems are not as capable as people because their ""perception and prediction algorithms are not as good as how a human brain processes and decides,"" said Chris Borroni-Bird, an independent consultant who previously led advanced-vehicle programs at GM and Waymo.

For instance, a human when seeing a ball roll into the road - harmless by itself - will assume it could be followed by a child and hit the brakes far quicker than an AV, Borroni-Bird said.

""I am concerned that AV companies will rush to market without proving the safety is better than human-driven vehicles,"" he added.

The problem is there are ""tens of billions of potential edge cases"" that AVs could encounter, said James Routh, CEO of AB Dynamics (ABDP.L), which conducts tests and runs simulations on cars including on the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) that are the foundation of autonomous driving features.

Auto data startup Wejo Group Ltd (WEJO.O) receives 18 billion data points daily from millions of connected cars and is helping with simulations for AVs, said Sarah Larner, executive vice president for strategy and innovation.

""But there are so many variables such as weather, you can take an edge case and then have to layer in all the different variants,"" she said. ""It's truly millions of outputs.""

DRIVERLESS DELIVERY

In its track tests for cars, AB Dynamics employs a robot arm that it plans to retrofit on slow-moving mining and agricultural trucks to make them largely autonomous.

Routh envisages a remote team of humans supervising fleets of, for instance, self-driving mining trucks operating in closed environments.

He does not see that scenario working for vehicles in faster, more open environments because it could be difficult for remote human supervisors to react quickly enough to dangers.

Within the next 12 months, British online food delivery and technology company Ocado Group Plc (OCDO.L) will roll out a small fleet of driverless delivery vehicles with autonomous vehicle software startup Oxbotica - backed by remote human supervisors - that will operate on just a few streets on set routes in a small UK city and never drive at speeds above 30 miles (48 km) per hour.

""At 30 miles an hour, if a vehicle panics, it can hit the emergency brake and seek help,"" Ocado's head of advanced technology, Alex Harvey, said. ""This feels like a very viable strategy at low speed.""

""But you can't play that game on a motorway,"" Harvey added, because hard stops in edge cases would pose a safety risk.

Harvey said it should take around five years for Ocado to develop a profitable driverless delivery system. More than half of Ocado's UK customers could be reached with AVs driving no more than 40 mph he said. Eventually, the service could be rolled out to Ocado clients like U.S. retail chain Kroger Co.

Founder and Chief Executive William Li hopes hitching cheaper products with Nio’s swanky services will capture market share for the loss-making company read more . But the strategy risks lengthening the road to profitability too.

Li built his $32 billion brand by going the extra mile to wow customers. Nio buyers enjoy perks including access to private clubhouses, and can opt into services like battery-leasing and battery-swapping, which cuts charging time from around 30 minutes to three minutes.

When Nio first sold cars five years ago, little luxuries helped convince consumers to try novel technology from an unknown brand. Today, its services set Nio apart in an increasingly crowded field of automakers. That will be more important from September when Nio launches a new, cheaper model priced at around 300,000 yuan, roughly $44,000, to compete with Tesla’s (TSLA.O) popular Model 3.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Affordable models would ideally allow Nio to increase volumes and creep closer to profitability but extravagant after-sales services elevate costs and undermine economies of scale. In the quarter ending March, when vehicle revenue grew 25%, the company’s operating loss rose 640% from a year earlier to $345 million. Management partly attributed increased expenses to battery-swapping. Nio is nonetheless committed. It’s currently implementing a plan to add thousands of new facilities over four years, and similar services will be available to buyers when it introduces a mass-market marque in 2024, Li said in June, without elaborating.

Nio’s not the only car company to invest in infrastructure and services to encourage electric-car adoption. Everyone from pioneers Tesla and Xpeng (9868.HK) to the venerable Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) owns or operates charging stations. However, few are as extreme as Nio, which has gone so far as to dispatch mobile charging vans that meet motorists on the road.

Li can get smarter about the extras as it heads down market. Nio could continue to offer battery rental options or even loans, reducing car buyers’ upfront payments by around a fifth, without committing to regular battery swapping and the infrastructure investments entailed. Alternatively, it could raise prices, but that would be at odds with its drive for more accessible and affordable models. More modest clients will bring rich challenges.

CONTEXT NEWS

Chinese electric-car maker Nio will hold its annual general meeting on Aug. 25.

Nio’s new mass-market brand, which is expected to launch in 2024, will feature models priced between 200,000 and 300,000 yuan, around $29,000 to $44,000, founder and Chief Executive William Li said on a conference call on June 9. The mass-market brand “will support battery swapping”, Li added, without elaborating. Battery swapping is a service whereby drivers can exchange car batteries for freshly charged powerpacks, rather than charging the batteries via a plug.

Separately, Nio expects to deliver the first of its new ET5 model in September, the company said in a press release in January. The vehicle will be priced at 328,000 yuan with the battery included, or 258,000 yuan for buyers who opt for Nio’s “Battery-as-a-Service” subscription, it added.

Summary

Summary Companies Crisis over Russian gas may mean electricity rationing

'Silent power struggle' between north and south

Southern industrial heartlands fret about power supply

Wind turbines, LNG terminals lift north's economic appeal

BERLIN, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Germany's wet and windswept north has long lacked the economic appeal of the industrial south but the green transition and an energy crisis sparked by war in Ukraine is shifting the balance.

When Northvolt sought a German site to build its first battery plant outside Sweden, it didn't pick the southern industrial heartlands, instead it chose to be near the blustery North Sea coast where the wind power industry has taken off.

""Battery manufacturing is tremendously energy-intensive,"" said Jesper Wigardt, Northvolt's head of public affairs. ""If you look at this part of Germany, it's interesting in terms of energy, but also the type of energy in the grid.""

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Northvolt's decision was announced on March 15, just as an energy crisis was unfolding, sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As the West has ratcheted up sanctions on Moscow, Russia has steadily reduced pipeline gas supplies to Europe.

""In reality we never got cheap gas from Russia,"" said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. ""We paid for each cubic metre of Russian gas twice or three times over in costs to our national security.""

Germany, heavily reliant on Russian gas in the past, is racing to wean itself off Russian supplies. The north coast will be at the heart of those efforts, both for generating more renewable energy and importing gas as fuel in the transition away from nuclear power and heavily polluting coal-fired plants.

Two floating terminals to receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be up and running on the North Sea coast within months, stopgaps until permanent ones are built there.

The northern states of Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern already produce half of Germany's 64 gigawatts (GW) of wind energy, now mostly land based. But these coastal states will play an even bigger role as Germany expands offshore wind generation to 70 GW by 2040 from 7.7 GW now.

The south, which powered Germany's economic revival after World War Two and which is home to industrial giants like BMW (BMWG.DE) and Siemens (SIEGn.DE) in Bavaria and Mercedes (MBGn.DE) in Baden-Wuerttemberg, now faces a rival in the north.

'SILENT POWER STRUGGLE'

It is shifting the compass on Germany's traditional tussle between the wealthy West and poorer, post-Communist East.

""There is a huge, silent power struggle underway between north and south,"" said the premier of one German state, who asked not to be identified.

And the north is gaining traction.

Tesla opened a factory in the northern state of Brandenburg in March, while Volkswagen - Germany's only carmaker based in the north - is building a new battery factory to equip its electric vehicles in Lower Saxony.

Also in Lower Saxony, Belgium's Tree Energy Solutions (TES) is planning to build a plant to produce hydrogen, initially making it from methane generated from food and other waste, and later splitting water via electrolysis powered by offshore wind.

Although Germany's most prosperous districts remain in the south, the fastest developing ones are in the north and west, according to the IW economic research institute which ranks the country's 400 districts based on factors ranging from tax returns to share of skilled workers.

""After decades of dominance by first the west then the south, now the north is getting going,"" said IW's Hanno Kempermann.

The power crisis may be helping tip the scales. Germany already needs to build more high-voltage interconnectors between the north and south, a requirement that will become increasingly pressing as more renewable power is generated in the north.

Bavarian premier Markus Soeder, whose state is home to some of Germany's industrial leaders, has repeatedly said the federal government was not doing enough to protect Bavaria's economy and has called for Germany's last three nuclear power stations be kept running to ensure industry does not suffer.

The federal government in Berlin says Soeder has been slow to develop wind power in his own state.

The government had aimed to close its last power plants by end of 2022 but adjusted the plan to keep two of them running into the spring. It still aims to exit nuclear power after that.

With Russian gas supplies dwindling, Germany is already at the second phase of a three-stage power emergency plan. The third stage would see electricity rationing for industry.

This month, Soeder appealed to Manuela Schwesig, premier of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the north, one of Germany's poorest states, offering the services of Bavarian state employees to help accelerate the building of an LNG terminal to ease the power crisis that could hit Bavarian industry.

A Bavarian government official said: ""Soeder visited Schwesig because there is a common interest in getting gas from north to the south.""
